Nigeria's kidnapping crisis: Dem suppose ban ransom payments?	"As pesin wey don pay ransom three times to comot im family for kidnapper hand, Nigerian businessman Lawal Ado no too happy with moves to ban payment to kidnappers, One controversial bill to criminalise ransom payments na di latest attempt to reduce di kidnapping business wey dey boom for di kontri. Di proposal na to jail any pesin wey pay for up to 15 years. Oga Ado say im two daughters bin dey drive with police convoy for Buruku road, Kaduna state, wey dey notorious for criminal gang, wen dem kidnap dem for December. Dem dey kidnappers hand for 15 weeks until im pay 10m naira ($24,000, 19,000) in cash, na wetin e tell BBC. Few years later, dem kidnap im wife from im house for Kaduna city and na 700,000 naira make dem release am. Dem kidnap im mama when she dey go her village also for Kaduna state and na with 300,000 naira, di kidnappers take free am. Oga Ado tok say wen you see say men wey carry gun dey threaten di lives of your loved ones, you no get choice but to drop money. Lawmakers wan ban ransom only because ""dem neva get family member wey dem kidnap"", na wetin im add. But lawmakers dey argue say dat kai payments na im dey ginger di kidnap industry wia criminal gangs go just tiff pipo and ask for anytin from $50 to $1m. Since 2011, kidnappers don make at least $18m, with almost half of di money, na between 2016 and 2020 dem make am. Dis na wetin SBM Intelligence wey be think-tank for Lagos dey report. Detective superintendent Eguaoje Funmilayo from Federal Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) say families dey fear to involve police and go just pay ransom instead, wey be something wey police no dey ike make pipo do. For rare sucess, police announce say dem gbab two alleged oga wey organize di kidnap of some university students wey dia parents bin cough out 200m naira so dem go free dem, earlier dis month. Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi - wey propose di bill say kidnapping don turn, ""di most deadly kind of banditry for Nigeria, e don become di most common and uncontrollable crime for di kontri."" Di bill don pass upper chamber and go now enta lower house. No place dey safe from kidnap gangs but dem plenti pass for Northern Nigeria. Ova di years dem don target airports, railways, military barracks and religious places Families of pipo wey dem kidnap dey most times sell property, collect loan from bank and crowdfund so dem go fit raise ransom. Di victims wey no pay ransom sometines dey killed, tori dey sat dem dey comot dia human organs carry sell. Usman Mbaekwe, wey spend five days for forest for southern Nigeria afta dem attack di bus im dey inside say, security forces no even try at all to save am. Dem free am afta im wife raise 1m naira ( 2,000, $2,400). For tori wey be like dem tiff am from Nollywood feem, dem carry di pipo wey gt di cash for road wey lead from Lagos to Sapele, inside di Niger Delta, wey dem tell dem to drop di money for side of road, na wetin im tok. Kontris like US and UK no dey pay ransom to kidnappers, say di best way to stop kidnapping na to stop di ginger. But for kontris like France, Germany, Spain and Italy, tori be say dem don pay millions of dollars to free dia citizens wey African jaguda pipo hold or elsewhere. Tori be say even Nigerian federal goment don drop correct money give kidnappers before, like give Boko Haram so dem go free some of di Chibok girls dem kidnap for 2014, as Kastina sef drop money for di di release of schoolboys dem kidnap for 2020. More recently, na di attack for di Abuja-Kaduna train for March. At least eight pipo die and tori be say 60 pipo dey di gunmen hand. Di kidnappers no ask for ransom but dey ask oda tins from goment, wey dey boost tok say to stop ransom no go end kidnapping. Imran Rufai wey im broda dey train attacker hand say ""payment of ransom no be di problem, na kidnapping"" Zara Aliyu, wey also get train kidnapped broda, gree say, ""you only fit pass dat kain bill if beta security dey"".

Dis na as Nigeria voting centre stage don dey heat-up ahead of di 2023 general election. President Muhammadu Buhari don tell all im cabinet members wit ambition to contest elections to resign. Court of Appeal on Wednesday disagree wit one ruling by di federal high court for Umuahia wey cancel di controversial Section 84 (12) of di Electoral Act 2022. On 19 March, 2021 one Federal High Court rule say Section 84 (12) no follow law, ask di Attorney General of di Federation to remove am from di Nigerian Electoral Act 2022. Di court say di law dey illegal and na violation of di provisions of di 1999 Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). So why ""Section 84 12 of Nigerian Electoral Act"" dey controversial? Di Appeal Court judge, Justice Evelyn Anyadike in her ruling uphold di Sections 66(1)(f); 107(1)(f); 137(1)(g); and 182(1)(g) of di 1999 Constitution wey say appointees of goment wey dey seek to contest elections go only resign at least 30 days to di date of di election, Di judge say any oda law wey mandate such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before dat day dey unconstitutional.

Airlines strike in Nigeria update: Ibom air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, odas go continue flight schedules as operators suspend action	"Di Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) don suspend dia plan to strike and stop flights schedule across di kontri. Di strike bin suppose start on Monday but di AON President Abdulmunaf Sarina tok inside statement wey six members of di association jointly sign say dem announce di suspension say dem do am in di interest of di national economy and security considerations. Di Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) bin don say di strike no go make sense and e go amount to exploitation if airlines suspend flights afta collecting money for tickets from passengers. Di operators dey complain of di increase in price of JetA1, wey be aviation fuel. Nigeria goment bin also beg di operators to ""reconsider dia stand"" sake of di effect. Di cost of JetA1, wey be aviation fuel don increase from N190 per litre to N700, dis na according to di airline operators of Nigeria. Abdulmunaf Sarina, president of di operators for letter wey e send to Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say di high cost of di fuel dey affect di operation cost of airlines. E say, ""while aviation fuel worldwide dey cost about 40% of airline operating cost globally, di present hike don increase Nigeria operating cost to about 95%."" Abdulmunaf Sarina say airlines dey run at a loss sake of di situation and e no good for dia business. ""Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wish to regrettably inform di general public say member airlines go discontinue operations nationwide wit effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice."" Nigeria Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika say true-true aviation fuel don cost and e dey affect air transport. But di minister say make di operators look for anoda means to address di mata rather dan suspend flight activities. E say, im no fit do much because mata wey concern fuel no dey under im ministry. ""While efforts to manage di situation dey on, we wish to appeal to di airline operators, even in di difficult situation, to consider di multiplier effect of shutting down operations, on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking dia business-informed decisions and actions,"" e tok for statement by im special assistant on public affairs, Dr James Odaudu. Dis no be di first time operators bin plan to take dis kain action. Wen e happun e dey affect air travel. For March dis year, di operators bin complain about di same aviation fuel but dem no fit reach resolution wit goment and stakeholders for di oil industry. Earlier dis year, airline operators increase price or air fare by 50%. For instance, a trip of N23,000 before increase to N50,000. Di operators claim say di increase for di price of tickets na sake of di high cost of aviation fuel. Air travellers complain wella during dat period but pipo still continue to travel by air. Wit di latest plan to bin suspend dia business, e no clear weda dem wan increase di price of dia ticket again. Di six airline operators wey bin sign di statement to suspend strike include Abdulmunaf - Managing Director of Azman Air; Shehu Wada - Executive Director of Max Air; and Obiora Okonkwo - Chairman of United Nigeria Airlines. Odas be Roy Ilegbodu - Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air; Abdullahi Mahmood - Chief Executive Officer of Aero Contractors; and Allen Onyema - Chairman of Air Peace. Earlier, di Ministry of Aviation bin assured Nigerians say members of AON bin dey review dia decision to withdraw services on Monday, May 9. Dem bin confam say Ibom Air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana Air, and odas go carry on with dia normal flight schedules. Incidents of insecurity don make some Nigerians avoid travelling by road. Di recent Kaduna-Abuja train attack by terrorists also neva comot from pipo mind. If airlines suspend dia operations as planned, Nigerians go begin look for oda means of traveling. Though Ibom airline don announce say dem no go join di suspension - only dem no go fit cater for all di thousands of travellers wey dey make dia trip by air. But di remaining alternative go come be di use of private jets or airplane charter. E get several private jet charter companies for Nigeria wey dey offer those services. Di service dey expensive. Findings show say, a 40 minute to one hour trip within di kontri, cost up to N2 million ($5,500). Some pipo fit also do join hire of a private jet wey fit carry specific number of pipo. Dem go share di bill among dem sef. E neva clear weda di airline suspension go take effect from Monday but pipo don begin reason oda alternatives."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-61369130

Sani say anytime e hear about di statistics for Radio or Television e dey remind am of im daughter and how she for don grow by now. Unlike before wey I no dey mind, now anytime I hear malaria stats for radio or TV e dey remind me of Halima and how she for don grow by now, Sani tok. She don already learn to siddon and me and her dey play wella anytime I dey house. Deaths from Malaria especially for pikin dem na im don make WHO approve one vaccine for children to treat Malaria. During di trials of di vaccine for Malawi, Ghana and Kenya dem find out say di vaccine reduce malaria cases by forty per cent. Di mother Zahrau Mustapha say she dey think of Halima every blessed day even though God don bless her with another Daughter, Safiya, wey recently clock nine months. Halima na my first child and I born her on 20th September 2019 and she die on 4th March 2020. No single day wey I no dey think of her. She add say di death of Halima don make dem dey take extra care in terms of protecting themselves from Malaria. After her death we buy extra mosquito nets and we dey quick enter and for our baby na double net for her because inside our net she get her own inside and also insecticide dey always dey now. Zahrau call on goments to bring back the mosquito spray wey dey happun before many areas before now.

Sani say for Gurin Gawa area wey dem dey for Kano no be only dem lose pikin from Malaria as some of im neighbours also suffer di same fate. For most cases, malaria dey transfer through di bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes - na more than 400 different species of Anopheles mosquito dey, of which around 30 dey carri malaria. Di mosquitoes wey dey spread di disease dey bite usually wen pipo dey sleep for night. As 25 April na World Malaria Day, dis na wetin you suppose sabi about di disease: Malaria signs - high fever, headache, and cold - go usually appear 10-15 days afta mosquito wey get infection bite. E fit dey small and hard to recognise say na malaria, but if dem no treat am within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria fit lead to serious sickness, wey fit lead to death. Dr Usman Qalbusunnah na medical doctor for Rigasa General hospital for Kaduna state (northwest Nigeria) and e say despite plenty efforts malaria still dey on di increase across di kontri. On a daily basis 60% of patients wey I dey attend to na malaria cases wey show say di illness still dey go up despite all efforts to end it. Anoda thing be say na di resistant form of malaria dey now wia be say treatment dey take longer in fact some patients go return to hospital after a week or two wit di same malaria symptoms. Dr Usman say prevention and not treatment na di way to go so far as Malaria dey concern because no matter di improvement in treatments if cases continue dey happun e no go augur well for society. Na goment get biggest role to play for dis issue, first provide good drainages for areas and also refuse dumps suppose dey far away from pipo. As for individuals pipo suppose make sure say dia homes dey clean and free from dirty, stagnant water and dirty wey dey attract mosquitoes and make pipo dey sleep inside treated mosquito nets.

Equiano Cable landing Lagos: Google undersea cable land Nigeria, wetin public go gain?	"Equiano cable wey tech giant Google plan to enable a five-fold increase in average internet speeds dey land Lagos Nigeria, so wetin public go gain? Nigeria na major landing point for di cable and di launch of dis digital access happun Thursday 21 April 2022. ""Dis Cable Landing [in Lagos] go provide approximately ""20 times more network capacity"" than di last cable dem build to serve di region."" Juliet Ehimuan, Director of Google for West Africa tok during one event to mark di launch. Better data connection and cheaper Internet, job creation and more go follow di launch, one Lagos goment official tok on Tuesday. Nigeria na Equiano second stop inside Africa, with future landings wey dey expected in Swakopmund, Namibia; and Melkbosstrand, South Africa. Equiano, wey name dey inspired by a Nigerian, go dey land at different points inside Africa, much like a road construction wey dey progress. Google Equiano na state of di art submarine Internet cable. Di tech search engine, Google, alongside one of dia major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC) na im dey arrange dis project. Di cable dey set to completely land on Friday, April 29, 2022. According to Google, di cable run from Portugal, through di West coast of Africa and all di way to South Africa. Di Internet cable, dey named after Olaudah Equiano, one historical abolitionist. And Equiano Cable get power of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes) wit higher levels of durability than di last cable dem build to serve di West African region. Tori be say for di landing site, wey dey Lagos island, dem plan to build massive new data centre. Google office wey tanda for Lagos dey serve all di kontries inside di West African sub-region. ""Through this network infrastructure, we project say by 2025 we go don create at least 1.6 million jobs."" Na wetin Google West Africa Director, Juliet Ehimuan tell di BBC. Di tech giant believe say dis infrastructure go boost Nigeria GDP by over $10billion dollars over a three-year period. Di subsea cable na West Indian Ocean Cable Company build am wit funding from Google to provide Open Access to internet service providers and businesses. If you dey wonder, submarine Internet cables na one of di primary reasons you fit easily read dis article. Na sake of dis technology you fit stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. So submarine cable launch and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria na like cause and effect. Nowadays, di average internet speed wey bin dey Nigeria na 18.7 Mbps, according to tech reviews - wey mean say internet data connection no too fast. For example, if you currently get a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, e go take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. Back in di early 2000s, na very few pipo bin get phones and computers, and accessing di Internet dat time bin require buying time for cybercafe. Even wen mobile phones become available, you go likely waste time loading one page wit plenti pictures or trying to stream a video. As more business owners increase dia interest in Africa, technology begin to improve. 2009 record a major mile stone during di launch of di MainOne submarine cable, wey be one private submarine cable wey today spread between Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire. Afta dis launch, companies like Glo and MTN launch dia own submarine cables inside Nigeria. And na so internet access too begin increase, and more tech companies begin open shop for di kontri. Experts don tok say wit improved internet access, Africa fit catch up wit development across di continent. All things being equal, Google Internet cable fit drop di average download time to 1.2 minutes from 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. Di tech giant don commit demsef to invest $1billion inside Africa in di next five years to improve access. If we believe Google claim, Equiano fit bring six times much faster Internet of 112 Mbps. Lagos be like di silicon valley of Nigeria, sake of say na di one state wey get high technology innovation. And di city wit over 22 million population na Nigeria commercial capital. Anoda major public gain fit dey for speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. Dis mean say you fit experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load. And, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts. Some Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data for di rate of 666. But all things being equal, dis fit drop to 140, according to wetin experts dey project from Equiano Cable landing. Google for July 2018 launch Google Station wey be dia fast speed internet station for Lagos, Nigeria. Wetin sweet pipo belle dat time na say e no go cost anytin to use dis internet, because na free! Na for Lagos Google announce dia partnership with Nigeria to bring free and fast internet to di masses. Nigeria no be di first kontri wia Google don do dis kain tin for - India, Mexico, Thailand and Indonesia don dey enjoy am already. Google Kontri Director for Nigeria, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, say di plan na to make sure say more Nigerians participate for digital economy. Google say anyone wey wan use dia free internet no need to worri about mago-mago pipo wey wan tiff dia personal information because di way dem don do am, e no fit happun. Google Station wey don launch for Lagos go allow Nigerians to enjoy internet wey dey 'fast, reliable and no go drop', all dey need na to dey any of di six locations wey Google Stations wey dey di city."

Kano State: Why Nigeria historic dye pits fit close down	"For more than six centuries, one area for di historic city of Kano for northern Nigeria na di home to dye pits, wia dem dey use ancient techniques to produce beautiful fabrics. Di materials - wey dem dey mostly dye for deep blue colour - don sell across Africa and di Middle East. But many pipo dey worry say di industry now dey at risk. 'Di young generation no wan join di dyeing,' one Baba Muhammad complain as he squat near one wide pit, wey full wit one colo, indigo coloured liquid. Di 75-year-old dip one piece of cloth into di hole, cover im hands wit rubber gloves. Di veteran dyer dey worry say im go be one of di last pipo to perform di ancient ritual as young pipo don get more modern taste. 'Dem prefer to go into business; dem like to design di fabrics, but no be to dye am.' Di Kofar Mata dye pits - wey dem establish for di beginning of di16th Century be di source of livelihood for thousands of local pipo. Na women dey usually create di unique design of di fabrics wey dem go twist and tie di material for dia houses into different shapes to produce di patterns. Dem go later give di tied clothes dem to di dyers. Kano city na one important economic hub for northern Nigeria and e get strong leg for di trans-Saharan trade for pre-colonial times. Historians dey tok of how Tuaregs - wey dem dey call 'blue men of the desert' - sake of di colour of dia clothes - dey visit di city. Wetin follow sweet pipo about di Kofar Mata fabric, na di locally sourced and natural ingredients wey dem dey use to dye di clothes. Till today, dyers tok say dem dey avoid artificial ingredients, and dey use things like di local indigo plant, wey dey give di material e colour. But based on how things be for now, dis ancient tradition don dey face plenty threats. One na di Boko Haram insurgency. As dis one don mean say customers no dey - especially those wey dey travel through di north-east of Nigeria wia di Islamist militants dey active. E don also affect those wey dey come from front.

Di rise of cheap abroad clothes na major wahala for local dyers. Dem say although di prices dey di same, competition dey as many customers prefer new and flashy modern designs.

""My seventh great grandpapa, Muhammadu Dabosa, na im be di founder of dis pit centre"". Di dyers say dem no dey gt any help from local or regional goments. Oga Hamisu say dem fit do more to preserve di industry wey get historical significance. E say, 'if goment buy our products and ginger pipo to buy am, we go thrive'. 'Imagine say di president or one govnor wear one of our Kofar Mata fabrics, even if pipo bin dey look am say e dey worthless before, e go become valuable.'

Nigeria vs Ghana: NFF get questions to answer about Eguavoen and Super Eagles - Reasons Nigeria no qualify for Qatar 2022 World Cup	"Tuesday 29 March 2022 na date wey many Nigerians no go ever forget. Dis na because na di date wey di Super Eagles fail to qualify for di 2022 Qatar World Cup afta dem lose to Ghana. Di Black Stars shock di over 60,000 pipo wey bin dey inside di Moshood Abiola stadium as dem win on away goal rule afta di match end 1-1. Di first leg for di Baba Yara stadium for Kumasi bin end goalless. Ahead of Tuesday match, Nigeria coach Austin Eguavoen bin dey confident say dem go beat Ghana but wetin really be di reasons wey make dem crash out? As di dust dey settle on di Super Eagles failure to qualify for Qatar 2022 World Cup, old actions by di Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) don dey rise again. Chief of which, na di sacking of German coach, Gernot Rohr just days before di Afcon go start. China Acheru believe say di NFF bin no get any plan afta dem sack Rohr and e show. ""A lot of pipo go tok of Gernot Rohr sack and dem tink say e dey wrong. I never call for Rohr sack but I support di sack and im bin come at di right time,"" Acheru tok. For Acheru: ""Nothing bin dey wrong about Rohr sack, wetin bin dey wrong na say di NFF bin no get plan afta dem sack Rohr. Dem push Paseiro name and den bring in Austin Eguavoen and dem say di Portuguese go take over. You know how e happen, e become complete mess."" Eguavoen before im takeover as interim coach bin dey serve as NFF Technical Director. Di former Super Eagles captain later step down from dat interim role on Wednesday according to di NFF. According to NFF, Eguavoen go return to im role as Technical Director but di coaching set up wey support am for Afcon and di new ones wey NFF add before di match against Ghana all don chop sack. Dis don make Nigerian football followers ask wetin di former Bendel Insurance and Sharks FC coach wan bring as Technical Director wen ""im fail to do well against Tunisia and also fail to beat Ghana?"". One fan wey BBC Pidgin tok to bin ask. Some also add join say Eguavoen return to im Technical Director role ""make zero sense."" For better context, di coaches of Algeria, Egypt and Democratic Republic of Congo all turn in dia resignation afta dem fail to carry dia kontris go di World Cup. Dis coaches no longer get anytin to do wit dos kontris but dat no be di case wit Eguavoen. A statement from di NFF say dem go announce new management team ""after proper review"" and dem go dey charged to ""give new energy to di Super Eagles to face future challenges appropriately"". Going into dis match tied at 0-0, di importance of di away goal rule become all di mor important. Especially as Ghana come score first through Thomas Partey shot from outside di box afta 10 minutes. Dat goal itself become ""massive lift for Ghana,"" according to ACLsports Chief Football writer, Fisayo Dairo. Di Super Eagles rally demsef back to equalise soon afta through Troost Ekong penalty but lack urgency for dia second half performance. Fisayo add say: ""At a time dem [Nigeria] need to continue with wetin dem do for di first half afta dem concede dem become flat."" Dat second half performance make one wonder if di players bin dey aware of di Fifa away goal rule. According to Fifa: ""Di aggregate score, wey be di team wit di most goals from di two matches, go determine di winner of Home & Away competition. If di game still dey tied, di side wit di most away goals go dey declared as di winner."" ""We need to fix our league, no be becos na im make us lose but e go prevent us from going to third division of Europe leagues to get a goalkeeper"". Na so Nigeria Football sabi pesin, China Acheru tell BBC Pidgin. Im bin dey refer to di mistake wey Francis Uzoho wey dey play for Omonia Nicosia of Cyprus make wey give Ghana early lead. Di 6 feet, 5 inches tall goalkeeper attempt to stop Partey shot see di ball go under im body and into di net. Uzoho bin be one of di shining light for di first leg against Ghana wey dem play for di Baba Yara stadium. ""I think we (Super Eagles) bin dey unlucky, on anoda day Nigeria for beat Ghana. I think di Eagles play better for Abuja dan dem do for Ghana."" Uzoho only make di starting lineup as Nigeria number one, Maduka Okoye bin dey ruled out of di match as im bin no well. But even before di Sparta Rotterdam goalkeeper absence against Ghana, question mark don dey about di goalkeeping position of di Super Eagles. Between di three senior goalkeepers for Nigeria - Okoye (13 caps), Uzoho (18 caps) and Daniel Akpeyi (19 caps) - none of dem don make more dan 19 times for di National team. Dis clearly point to di fact say not one of dem don fully get di trust of coaches wey don handle di team. Even factors like injuries to Uzoho and Okoye sickness don play role of dis evenly shared caps. Even before dis play-off match, Nigerians bin don dey quick to point to Okoye error wey see Tunisia beat dem 1-0 for di round of 16 of Afcon 2021. Im poor judgement on di flight of di ball see Youssef Msakni score di only goal wey eliminate di much fancied Super Eagles. Some go argue say Uzoho (23) and Okoye (22) still dey young wen compared to di careers and longevity of goalkeepers but for how long Nigerians go continue to wait for dat trusted hand in between di goal?"

Mothers day quotes: Mother's Day 2022 dates and why pipo dey celebrate am plenti times	"Some Nigerians dey celebrate Mother's Day today, 27, March, 2022. Mother's Day na special day to honour di mama of di family, na day to honour motherhood, maternal bonds and di power of mothers for di society and e dey celebrated throughout di world. But pipo don argue say Mother's Day celebration na one of di most confusing celebrations for di world, especially for Nigeria. Wetin dey cause di confusion no be di celebration itself but di actual date of di event. Starting from February for every year, Happy Mother's day messages go don begin dey pop up, pipo go don begin dey send tribute to dia beloved mama. Na so di messages go flow enta March, April, May, August and some oda months of di year. Di confusion even grow wen Catholic and Anglican Church choose separate days to celebrate Mother's Day. Mother's Day celebration dey happun for more than 50 kontris across di world, but all kontris no dey celebrate am di same day. Di celebration dey fall for different days for many parts of the world and e depend on which part of di world you dey live or di one you like to follow. E dey important to know say Mother's Day wey dey most time fall on Sunday for some kontris get dia root for di traditional catholic and Anglican church where dem dey call am mothering Sunday. Mother's Day dates dey change every year because e dey related to di celebration of Easter Sunday wey also dey change because e dey follow di Lunar Calendar. For some kontris, Mother's Day celebration na every fourth Sunday of Lent. Mother's Day na unofficial event for Nigeria because goment no recognize am unlike oda kontris where goment official declare di day. How Mother's Day celebration take start dey traced to di times of di ancient Greeks, wey dey always do festivals to honour Rhea and Cybele, di mother of di gods. During di Middle Ages, e get custom wey dem get to allow wey don move comot from where dem born dem to go back go go visit their home or 'mother' churches, and their mothers, on di fourth Sunday of di Christian festival of Lent. Dat time e dey common for children to leave home go work when dem still dey young like 10 years old, so dis na opportunity for families to meet again. Dis become Mothering Sunday for Britain. Although UK dey call am Mother's Day, e no get any connection wit di American Mother's Day. For US, Mother's Day dey celebrated on di second Sunday of May each year. Di idea start for America when one woman Anna Jarvis hold one small memorial service for her own mother on 12 May 1907. Soon afta, most places for America begin dey observe di day and in 1914, di US president turn am to national holiday, wey dem go dey celebrate on di second Sunday of May. Lots of oda kontris dey celebrate Mother's Day at different times of di year as well. Guernsey, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Nigeria and United Kingdom dey celebrate Mother's Day in di fourth Sunday of Lent - Meaning say dis year, 2022, Mother's Day for dem na Sunday, 27 March. Mother's Day 2022 for America na Sunday, 8 May. UK get different date dan America becos di date of Mother's Day for UK dey connected to Easter, wey dey change every year. UK, Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man and Nigeria all get di same date for Mother's Day. For Mexico and many parts of Latin America, dem dey celebrate Mother's Day on May 10th of each year. Thailand, dey celebrate am on August 12th, di birthday of di current Queen. Some other kontris dey join am wit di International Women's Day. Dem include Russia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Afghanistan, Romania and odas. ""To describe my mama go be to write about a hurricane in im perfect power.""

""But di challenge be say say di running cost for generator, cost pass to get inverter."" Becos you go dey buy fuel steady and Nigeria currently dey face fuel scarcity palava wey don make di price of petrol go up.

Di graduate of philosophy na one of several hundred Africans, from kontris like Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa and Algeria, wey say dem dey willing to take up arms for battle against Russia, partly to escape di hardship wey many young men dey face at home. ""We sabi say na war, no be childs play,"" im tell BBC. ""But to be soldier for Ukraine go dey beta dan to stay here. ""If dem fit allow me stay wen di war end, plus I be hero and fight an undeniable enemy."" Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba say about 20,000 volunteers from across di world don already apply to enlist. Dem come afta Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky beg di world for foreign fighters to ""come and stand shoulder to shoulder wit Ukraine pipo"". Di goment don temporarily reduce im visa requirements and offer equipment plus salary to pipo wit valid passport and military training. E no get any official confirmation say dem go allow foreign fighters stay for di kontri afta di war.

If I want to go to Europe, I go do am through education, not war,"" di 29-year-old lawyer said. ""Dis na about bullying - injustice for one na injustice for all."" Dis na sentiment wey go totori di hearts of Ukraine diplomats and some days afta President Zelenksy begging, dozens of hopeful volunteers waka go Ukraine embassy for Abuja, wit ambitions of enlisting.

Aviation fuel: Nigeria airlines warn of more flights cancelation or delays	"Major airline for Nigeria don alert dia customers of more flight delays and cancellations in days ahead. Di alert na sake of di scarcity of Jet fuel or aviation fuel wey dem dey experience. For days now, different airlines across Nigeria don dey release press statements to express challenge dem dey face.

For February 2021 airlines dey buy dia fuel for N190 per litter, by di end of di year di price increase to between N350 and N370. Dis na why Dana Air for im own statement say, ""di aviation fuel crisis dey take new turn."" As tins dey now and from di statements wey di different airlines don release dis past days, weitn next for Nigerians wey dey fly as means of transport go dey difficult to imagine. Already, travellers don dey experience flight delays and in some cases sef dem cancel dia flight.

Nigeria don dey experience fuel scarcity since di beginning of February, afta goment reject one batch of imported fuel wey contain too much methanol. Di too much methanol make am impossible for di kontri pipo to fit use am. Again, pipo wey dey import aviation fuel dey find am hard to get dollars to pay for dia products.

Roland Iyayi, wey be former managing director of Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, tell tori pipo Bloomberg say; Di shortage of foreign currency, plus increasing oil price, increase prices of aviation fuel to as high as 607 naira ($1.45) per liter for some airports for di kontri.

For 2019, Evolving first share her tori wit BBC News Pidgin and now almost three years from dat time, she follow share how tins be now. Dat time she bin share say bicos say she be intersex, to form stable relationships bin no dey easy. But now, she dey happily married. Yes o! Mx Mystique marry her ""Mr Right"" for 2021. Some of di challenges she bin tok about be tins like support from family, surgery, achievements and even marriage. ""My experience afta I officially announce to di world say I be intersex bin dey really positive and challenging. ""Afta dat interview a lot of pipo reach me, some bin encourage, a lot of pipo bin dey say dem no believe say we (intersex) dey for Nigeria, some wan find out more. Actually, pipo begin to propose. And dat part surprise me."" Na one di pipo wey reach out to propose na im she say ""I-do"" to. Before she meet her husband, Mystique say she bin dey avoid relationships becos she no too sure. ""No be today, I like you, I like you, I like you, di next tine dem don start to dey... you know."" She say she bin no even give her husband face di first time wey im bin dey come find am to marry, until di man make one statement one day. ""Im make one statement say as a mata of fact, I no want make you do di surgery, dat na why I dey follow you bumper to bumper. I dey tell myself say, na your kain pesin I bin wan marry wen I bin young but I no know say di future go be like dis."" Na dis point she decide to give di relationship a chance. In her words, she tok say her experience wit her husband make her understand say: ""For dis world wey believe dey say na just man and woman God create. Say odas no dey exist. But no! Odas exist. And if odas exist, dat mean say e get some pipo wey go love dis odas."" For 2019, she bin tok about how she and family bin no dey gel sotay dem claim say she be gay. ""...di last experience wey I bin get wit dem (my family), I almost die."" She tok say dem beat her wella, even cut her hair and drag her for floor and say na only her younger brother be her support.

Mystique say all dis one surprise her but she bi no believe dem at first based on past experience but she say as time pass, she come relax to accept dem. As e be so, her relationship wit her family don settle and dem dey on good terms. Mystique say one major challenge wey she bin get be say pipo around her begin question her identity especially pipo wey no understand di difference between transgender and intersex. ""Many pipo no understand say transgender, na gender identity, intersex na sex characteristics. So intersex pesin fit be transgender, fit identify as cisgender, fit identify as nothing.""

But dis one no be true Intersex na pesin wey come dis world wit two sex organs, man and woman. Many intersex pipo dey confused about who dem be and which gender dem belong weda man or woman. E no possible to categorise dis group of pipo as man or woman as dem no be any of di two. Intersex dey for Nigeria as dem dey for all di kontris for world. But kontris wey officially recognise say dis group of pipo dey exist dey refer to dem as non-binary or odas. Meaning say dem no be man and dem no be woman. Dem get many different varieties of intersex and most times e dey hard to know from small pikin weda dem be man or woman until di pesin grow. Sabi pipo say one out of evri 2,000 pipo wey come world, one na intersex. But e hard to know exactly how many dey for Nigeria as many of dem dey hide who dem be, and parents wey get moni dey sharply go do surgery for dia pikin wen im small. Transgender na pesin wey identify imsef or im gender differently from di sex wey dem give am wen dem born am. Some transgender pipo wan to do surgery to change from one sex to anoda. But many odas prefer to dey as nature take create dem. Cisgender identity na pesin wey identify imsef or im gender di same as di sex wey dem give am wen dem born am."

Nigeria rice: Production don increase or na just hype?	"Di Nigerian goment don hail increase of di production of local rice production as ogbonge achievement. Dem also hala say di kontri dey now even export rice. But di opposition don hala say dem just dey inflate di actual production numbers. Nigeria opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) say dem believe di ruling All Progressives Congress party dey exaggerate di way local rice production dey increase for di kontri. Dia tok-tok pesin Debo Ologunagba tell BBC say ""if di production of local rice don increase, e for don show price ofr market"". Di most reliable numbers recently wey we find na di US Department of Agriculture, wey bin predict say Nigeria rice production go reach fie million tonnes for 2022. Di report show sat di production rate bin rise well-well between 2015 and 2017 and jump again for 2020. And while Nigeria goment show beta rise of rice production from 2015 and 2016, dem no get any dat a for di last few years. Di land wey dem dey plant di rice don increase. E increase from 3.1 million hectares (7.7 million acres) for 2015 to 5.9 million hectares for 2018, and then come drop again to 5.3 million hectares for 2020, wey be di latest numbers wey UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) get data for. Di goment don dey provide beta seeds and fertiliser give smallholder farmers and then sama more money for irrigating schemes. For 2014, dem start program wey go help farmers to fit rent machine dem so e go improve mechanisation of rice farming. In fact, some states dey give land concessions, wey mean special allowance to large scale farmers make dem take plant. For November 2015, di Central Bank of Nigeria start programme wey farmers fit get loans with beta interest rates, in fact, dem fit even pay back di loans with dia produce. Recently, for Abuja, dem bin display rice pyramids to show di success of di rice production like dem bin dey do with groundnut for di 1950s say na beta part of dia economy. President Muhammadu Buhari bin say di beta production ""go help make di price of rice for Nigeria to reduce"". But di price of rice still dey rise. Goment data show say di price to produce rice don dey increase wey go lead to higher prices. And even as di production of rice don rise in di past ten years, demand too follow am increase. Khadijat Amolegbe, from di University of Ilorin say, ""di increase of di quantity of rice dey meet di increase for demand sake of say population dey grow"". Kasala between herders and farmers for di north-west and central Nigeria for recent years don also affect prices on top say e pursue rice farmers comot dia farms. But e no clear how many farmers dey affect and how much land di kontri don lose on top insecurity. Even bad roads don also lead to why di prices dey high. On top all dat, US data show say Nigeria dey chop seven million tonnes for inside, so di kontri even still need additional two million tonnes of rice make equation balance. Because of di shortage between production and demand, Nigeria don dey import rice and sometimes na smuggling e dey take enta di kontri. Last month Oga Buhari say dem no dey import any rice and say di kontri even dey export di rce e dey produce. But official data no dey for di exports and we bin fit find from goment wetin be di evidence for di exportation of rice wey dem dey claim. As for imports, Nigeria bring restrictions for 2015 to boost local production we include: Even though goment say Nigeria no dey import rice, US report say Nigeria dey import reach two million tonnes for recent years. And for December 2021, one Nigeria Senate committee agree with di figure of rice say dem dey ""either import or smuggle illegally enta di kontri""."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-60467334

Pipo wey dey pay rent for Nigeria fit stop to pay one year in advance	"To get decent place to live na difficult tin any wia, but to look for 12 months' rent wey pesin go pay in advance na extra burden wey millions of Nigerians dey face. Landlords prefer to collect plenty money upfront as e dey reduce di chance of tenants to default. E better to chase tenant once instead of to dey chase dem 12 times a year, na so dem reason am. But dis system dey about to change. Lawmakers dey debate one law to make yearly upfront rent illegal for Nigeria capital, Abuja, while authorities for di biggest city, Lagos, don choose di voluntary scheme wey go begin next month. Di Lagos state goment dey hope say by acting as a guarantor for di new payment system, landlord get fit begin accept monthly rents. Many residents, especially young pipo wey just dey start family like di idea of monthly rents. Tunde Omotayo, wey wan marry for April, dey face challenge of raising 600,000 to 800,000 naira ($1,500-$2,000; 1,000- 1,400) for ""decent apartment"" for mainland Lagos as e plan to move out of im friend house afta im wedding. For pesin wey dey on monthly salary of 300,000 naira di tin go hard am. ""I bin tink say my salary go fit easily take care of my rent but e shock me. At dis point, I no go mind to pay my rent monthly because as tins stand I dey confused,"" e tell di BBC. If e register for di new system e mean say im go pay about 50,000 naira a month, wey make am believe say di pressure go reduce as im wedding don near. As one of di world fastest-growing city, demand for housing for Lagos dey increase every day, and house no cheap. Two-bedroom apartment close to di city main business district, Victoria Island, go for between $11,000 and $22,000 a year while low-to-middle-income housing fit cost anywia between $500 and $5,000 for mainland. Na for di tenant to raise di money, and di majority of working-class Nigerians don get to master how to save money every month to pay di annual rent. Some of di pipo wey e no easy for to save dey borrow from loan sharks wit interest charges wey reach 28% per month, while a few odas dey collect no-interest loans from dia employers to cover di rent. Flat-sharing also dey popular for young middle-class pipo for Lagos so different pipo fit gather dia money togeda take pay di plenty annual rent. Many odas don move go into neighbouring Ogun state wia house rent dey cheap, but dem go need to travel long distance go work for Lagos. Pam Christopher, wey just move come Lagos from Jos, for central Nigeria wia rents cheap well-well, no believe di $2,400 rent wey landlord ask am to pay for two-bedroom apartment on mainland Lagos. ""House na gold here,"" e tell di BBC. ""I need di two-bed because I plan to move my family here and now e be like say I no go fit afford am,"" e tok. Im dey currently live wit im friend and e dey seriously hope for goment intervention, wey state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu say dem ""design to make pipo pay dia rents according to dia monthly salary"". But as businessman Tosin Emmanuel afta e reason di monthly payment discover say ordinary speech no go fit convince landlords for Lagos ""One landlord ask weda na goment buy am land and build di house for am. E say go goment fit determine how e go collect im rent. ""Di man say make I go meet [Governor] Sanwo-Olu to give me house,"" oga Emmanuel tell BBC. For di scheme to dey successful, di goment dey depend on di support of powerful landlords Lagos. But dat one go hard. ""Yearly rent no be wetin we suppose dey discuss because many house-owners depend on am for survival,"" landlord Ayem Ojie tell di BBC. Oga Ojie get house for Ikorodu, out of Lagos and say im an many oda house-owners build dia properties to fund dia retirement. ""Financial planning dey easy wen you collect di money in bulk,"" e tok. ""To maintain building demands bulk money, no be small-small,"" na so Lekan Ade wey get house for di middle-class Ilupeju area on di mainland tok. Demand for housing high pass supply by far for Lagos and di rental sector don become sellers' market, wia those wey get di property dey determine wetin tenants must do. Although goment say dem don build 14 public housing schemes since 2019, wia civil servant dey pay low rents, di house no still dey enough wey make private developers take over. Dem build wetin dem like and charge as dem want for dis sector wey dem no dey too regulate. But many tenants wey don already get house no dey too interested in changing di system. Nigerians dey used to pay upfront for things; cars, phones, school fees, and some mortgage facilities dey for those wey wan buy house. Adaobi Asuoha, wey dey live for di middle-class Ajah district of Lagos Island, prefer to pay her rent yearly as e allow her to fit use her money as she like for di rest of di year. ""Di monthly rental fee dey good but yearly payment dey comot di pressure from pesin body. Some months dey wen I fit need my entire money for something else,"" she tell di BBC. She dey gather her rent by saving some part of her salary everi month, Asuoha tok. Dis mindset of saving plenty money na a reflection of Nigerian culture of upfront payments, na so banker Kayode Omosebi tok. E believe say Nigerians no too sabi pay monthly bills or pay by instalment, and say pipo see rent as investment. ""For place wia job security and oda bills no dey guaranteed, pipo no wan joke wit dia shelter,"" e tok. If dem don pay for one year in advance, that na something wey dem no go need to worry about for anoda 12 months. Even di goment realise say dia ambitious monthly payment plan dey in the hand of di powerful landlords and fit dey dead on arrival. ""We know say we no fit enforce monthly rent collection on landlords,"" na so Toke Benson-Awoyinka, special adviser to di Lagos govnor on housing tok. But di goment say dem come up wit di new scheme afta consultations wit all stakeholders and dem see any reason why e no fit work."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-60292147

Soot in Port Harcourt: Wetin don hapun afta Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike declare war against kpo fire operators?

For im new year message on 1, January, 2022, Governor Wike declare 19 alleged illegal oil bunkering kingpins wanted and direct traditional rulers and all di 23 local goment chairmen for di state to locate, identify and report to im office all those wey dey behind illegal bunkering and crude oil refining sites to in office for dia localities for prosecution. Two weeks later, di govnor bin declare total war against illegal crude oil bunkering afta im visit two sites for Ibaa, Emohua LGA and Ogbodo for Ikwerre LGA wia illegal crude oil bunkering dey go on and see di level of devastation e don cause di environment. Di govnor bin give 48 hours ultimatum to all di 23 local goment chairmen to submit di list of illegal crude oil bunkerers to am and e promise to give dem two million naira for evri new one dem discover. Local goment chairmen begin enter deep inside dia localities, across di riverine and upland areas to discover illegal crude oil bunkering and artisanal refining sites.

Di Rivers State Police Command likewise redeploy di DPO di govnor accuse and set up panel to investigate di mata. 'Harm to di environment' One of di actions some of di local goment chairmen dey take na to set some illegal crude oil refining sites on fire or burst and burn di storage tanks wia dem store di illegally refined crude oil products dem discover. Dis dey cause serious concern among environmentalists as dem observe say such actions dey add to di destruction of di environment. Prof. Precious Ede of di Rivers State University say one way to handle dis na for dem to handover such products dem seize from illegal crude oil refining sites to agencies of goment like di Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC and Department of Petroleum Resource DPR, (wey now don become Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission) wey get di capacity to handle such products. Prof. Ede wey bin dey di committee wey di Rivers State goment put togeda to chook eye into wetin dey cause di black soot pollution for di state say part of dia recommendations afta dem identify wetin dey cause am, na for di state goment to get facilities wia dem go fit receive dis illegally refined products afta dem seize dem from di sites. E dey concerned about di sustainability of wetin di goment don start, ""e go still continue afta dis period or even afta im comot for office? E ask. Di one wey we dey see some of di LGA chairmen dey destroy some sites with fire or pour am for di environment no dey good because dis crude oil or petroleum products na hazardous products wey no good.

Di problem with giving dis task to local goment chairmen be say, I no see how dem dey equipped to do di job and di mechanism dem go apply. But di mandate for dem to identify and destroy dey very disturbing because di illegal refineries for di bush na basic construction wey no need to dey destroyed because to destroy am na to create more harm to di environment and create more pollution to di forest, di creeks and swamps and e go take ages before dem fit repair di harm e go cause. Wetin I feel say di goment fit do na to send experts to go dis sites di local goment chairmen don identify go dismantle di basic contraptions dem build as refineries and collect di stored crude and products wey di refiners don steal and put dem for a place wia dem fit safely and properly dispose dem. Rev. Nnimmo Bassey tok. Di black soot pollution don stop? Di major reason why di Rivers State Governor declare dis war na to stop di black soot pollution wey pipo for di state don dey complain about since 2016.

And dem hold am as di biggest wrapper wey women for Ibani kingdom dey tie before dem go tie george wey dem dey call lili-inji wey be senior intorica (george wrapper), she add.

You fit dey interested to watch dis video Mrs. Hannah Ejekwu say di Iria womanhood ceremony get three stages according to age: ""Di first one we dey call am Kala- Egerebite na for girls wey dey between di ages of 12 and 15 years. Di second one, Opu - Egerebite na for girls between ages 18 to 21."" ""Di third one na for older pipo wey don reach age 40 and above na im dey do dat ceremony. Dat one na Bighibite ceremony."" She explain say for di first stage, kala-egerebite, di girl go tie native wrapper wey dem dey call suu. She go tie dat one short, with coral beads. For di second stage, opu- egerebite she go tie one waist of Ikaki (akwete), Popo and Damask di soft one (Lo bite) with matching blouses. Then di last stage wey be Bighibite, she go tie di Awomie bite dat na di george dem dey dye. She say dat na di most important cloth and after dat she go tie lili-inji wey be intorica george. Hannah observe say if woman no do any of di stages as she dey grow till she become full adult, wen she dey do di Iria ceremony, she must do all di oda stages from di Kala Egerebite to di Bighibite. And di woman go tie all di different types of traditional wrapper dem complete, she add. ""For di tying of wrapper, e get di stage wey wen di girl dey young, she go tie one waist like wen she tie di Ikaki, Popo and Damask na only one she go tie with her blouse. Den di last stage wen she tie di Awu, den she fit begin tie di george wrapper and she go begin tie two waist wrapper with her blouse. If she never tie di Awomie bite, she no fit tie two pairs of di george wrapper, according to di woman. ""If she never do any of di stages before, wen she wan do di iria, we go follow all di stages one after di oda from di kala- Egerebite wia she go tie suu, to di opu-egerebite wia she go tie di ikaki, popo, Damask. ""To di third stage di Bighibite wia she go tie Awomie-bite and di lili-inji, dat is intorica george. She must do all till e complete. Then she dey free from embarrassment."" Di iria ceremony dey start wen di iriabo (di maiden turning into full woman) go go church with her parents and her pipo, according to wetin Hannah Ejekwu narrate. Di parents go inform dem say dem wan tie dia pikin wrapper. Dat day she go dress well buy she go tie her wrapper short with matching blouse and headtie to do am. Then dem go follow dem come house. Di second stage, Hannah say dem dey call am 'Wari so', dat na to enter di fattening room. Dia dem go rub di Iriabo white chalk, rub her palm oil, turmeric to make her body fine and her skin to glow. Dem go also draw beautiful patterns for her body to decorate her and give her good food, feed her well so she go fat, dey shine so wen she come out pipo go admire and see say she fine well well. And dat one dey also attract potential husband to come ask for her hand in marriage. Mrs. Ejekwu say to stay for di fattening dey depend on how di iriabo want am. ""Wen me I do my own, na three months I stay inside di fattening room but nowadays, di girls no dey fit stay because of school and work. ""Some no wan fat so some dey stay one week, some two weeks before dem come out. ""Di third and last stage na di one dem go dress her di wrapper one after di oda starting wit Ikaki (Akwete), di Popo, di Damask (di soft one dem dey call Lo bite) and di wrapper dem call Awu dat na cooked wrapper, di george dem go dye am. Dis na di biggest wrapper for Ibani kingdom. Wen she don tie dat cloth, she don enter inside george (bighibite). Now she fit tie george - all di different types of george wrapper weda na plain george, intorica, dat is di senior george wrapper. Dis na di last stage. Di following day Sunday, di iriabo with her parents and family pipo go go church again go do thanksgiving to thank God for a successful iria ceremony."" After dat di Iriabo dey expected to tie complete two pairs of wrapper with head tie, dress properly as a full Ibani woman anytime she dey come out for at least one year. Some pipo dey do for six months too. But going forward anytime she dey attend any occasion for Ibani kingdom or she dey attend occasion wey any Ibanise pesin dey do be it marriage, chieftaincy or any gathering of Ibanise, she dey expected to dress complete with two wrapper. She fit tie two waist of any of di traditional wrappers and dem go recognize her. Mrs Hannah Ejekwu emphasize say woman wey never do dis iria ceremony no fit tie two waist George wrapper or any of di traditional wrappers waka for street for Ibani kingdom. Dis according to her, na because dem go comot one of di wrapper from her. ""Women wey never do iria go tie only one wrapper, she no go tie two. If she no know herself come tie two wrapper, women wey don do iria go confront her, comot one of di wrapper from her waist. ""And question why she dey tie two wrapper wen she never do iria and dem go seize dat wrapper. Dat na big disgrace."" ""If you go out now for wia dem dey dance, you go see say those young young girls, na only one wrapper dem tie"" Dis na ""because dem never do iria, but di one wey don do iria, dem tie di two pairs of wrapper - up and down, dress well wit better head tie."" She add say woman wey never do iria no fit tok wia women gada because dem go shut her up and walk her out. ""As she never tie wrapper, she no get say for wia we dey so dem go walk her out."" Hannah add say Ibani Se [Ibani pipo] hold dis tradition very high and recently, dem don make am an important requirement for women wey wan contest election or hold political office. She must be pesin wey don do her iria ceremony so dat she go get say and command di respect of di community, Hannah add. As e pertain to marriage, she explain say tying of wrapper na di first tin a woman suppose do before she marry. Dis na because di tradition na say wia women wey don tie wrapper gada sidon, weda she don marry or not, if she never do iria, she no go fit tok wia dem dey. She no fit appear before dem for Ibani-Se. Also, wen man come to marry Ibani daughter wey never do di Iria ceremony, di family for also demand di Iria as dowry wey be say di man go promise to do di Iria ceremony for her. So di family go always look forward to di time I'm go fulfil dat promise to honor dia daughter. But originally na tradition parents dey do for dia girl pikin to cover her nakedness and show say she don mature. Sake of di big wrappers, jewellery and accessories wey dey involved in iria ceremony, many pipo say Iria na very expensive ceremony. But Mrs. Hannah Ejekwu say e no dey as expensive as dem assume, e depends on how di pesin want am. ""Dis tying of wrapper na how you want am na im you go do am, e no too cost. If you get money you want do am big you do am like dat."" ""You no get money you wan do small, you do am like dat too but di main tin na say you don do am, so do as your power reach. ""E dey like wedding, some pipo dey do am society wedding invite plenti pipo, some dey do am small too but di tin be say dem don marry. ""Na so e be. But some pipo want dance and invite pipo, celebrate big and so dem dey keep am tay till dem don old, wen dem get money. Na dia choice."" Dis woman wey dey narrate di tori stress say dis ceremony dey so important dat if Ibani woman no do am wen she dey alive, wen she die her family must do am for her before dem bury her for Ibani land. ""If because she no get money, she no do dis iria and she die, her parents [pipo] go do di ceremony for her deadbody as dem lie am for bed; Na so dem go put all di wrapper dem for her body one by one dey remove am wit di blouses to match. So evribodi want to do am wen dem dey alive. Even if she die for London, dem bring di deadbodi come back but she never tie wrapper. Dem must do di ceremony on di deadibody before dem put am for ground bury."" Anoda thing na say, if a Bonny girl marry man wey from anoda place, she must also do di iria ceremony. Likewise for Ibani man wey marry woman from anoda tribe, for her to seat among women for di land, im go also do di iria ceremony for im wife too for her to be a full fledged Bonny woman. Anoda misconception wey pipo dey get about di Iria ceremony according to Mrs Hannah Ejekwu na say iria ceremony dey fetish and e dey associated with juju, but she say no be so. She say dis don discourage some pipo not to do di ceremony because dem no wan get anything to di with juju but she say e no dey like dat because as dem dey carry out di processes. Dem no dey invoke any ancestral spirits or pour libation, rather na prayers dem dey pray and at di end, di iriabo dey go do thanksgiving for church. Oda Ibanise nations like Opobo and Andoni for Rivers State also dey do di iria Egerebite and Bighibite womanhood ceremonies although with slight differences in di way dem dey do di rite of passage. Even di Okrikas and Kalabaris also dey do iria ceremony to honour and celebrate womanhood. Mrs Hannah Ejekwu come advise young Ibanise girls to keep di iria tradition because e dey bring honour and respect to womanhood. And e dey show di high place di society put women as e go give dem recognition and opportunity for dem to contribute meaningfully to develop dia community."

To prevent destruction of crop farms, community ponds, settlement and property by open grazing of livestock. 2. To prevent clashes between nomadic livestock herders and crop farmers 3.

Nigeria government declare bandits as terrorists - See wetin fit hapun next	"Federal Goment of Nigeria don officially declare bandit groups wey dey operate for any parts of di kontri as terrorists. Di declaration dey inside di Federal Goment Gazette wey ban and forbid dia existence and stop any pesin or group of pesins from participating inside activities of any of di groups. Dem release di official Gazette wey di Attorney General of di Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, sign on Wednesday 5th January, 2022. Dis one dey come afta di Federal High Court for Abuja, Nigeria ruling wey declare bandit groups as terrorists. For inside di ruling wey Justice Taiwo Taiwo deliver on Friday, 27, November 2021, di court say di activities of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta'adda bandit groups, na acts of terrorism. Di ruling follow di ex parte motion wey di Federal Goment of Nigeria bin file through di Federal Ministry of Justice. Di Gazzette say di activities of Yan Bindiga Group, Yan Ta'adda Group and oda similar group for Nigeria dey declared as terrorism and dey illegal for any part of Nigeria especially for di North West and North Central regions of di kontri dey proscribed according to sections 1 and 2 of di Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011. ""Consequently, di general public dey hereby warned say any pesin or group of pesins wey dey participate in any manner whatsoever in any form of activities wey involve or concern di prosecution of di collective intentions or odawise of di groups wey dey referred to for inside paragraph 1 of dis notice go dey violate di provisions of di Terrorism (Prevention) Proscription Order Notice, 2021. Security Sabi pesin, Rtd Col Hassan Stan-Labo say goment declaring bandit for di kontri na game changer for di fight against di bandit. E say by dis pronouncement, di military don get authorization to use lethal weapon like A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets wey dem acquire from di United States last year. E further explain say di US goment bin place some restriction on how Nigeria go use di fighter jet sake of concerns of human rights abuse and sake of dis restriction, di military no fit use di jet to bomb di hideout of di bandits like dem dey for north east but now wey dem don declare dem as terrorist, di security go now go very tough on di bandits.

Nigeria get 12 of dis aircraft but oga Stan-Labo say make security no treat di bandit wit kid glove and dat make dem bombard dem and finish dem for Naija within di coming months. Bandits don dey operate for north west and north central Nigeria. Dem dey kidnap for ransom and attack villages and kill- kill pipo. Sake of dis, some govnors for north west like di Kaduna state Govnor, Nasir El-rufai bin call make di military bomb dia base. Sake of di restriction, di military engagement bin no dey hard but wit dis development, experts believe Nigeria fit win di battle against di bandits. Di armed bandits wey dey mostly operate out of abandoned forest reserves dey terrorise and attack communities for di kontri north-west region. Dem be di latest groups to join Nigeria kidnap for ransom industry. In di last ten years, more dan 8,000 pipo don die in di states of Kebbi, Sokoto, Niger and Zamfara, according to di International Crisis Group. Di attacks fit dey traced to years of competition over resources between ethnic Fulani herders and farming communities. Meanwhile, controversial Islamic cleric Sheikh Gumi bin don condemn di Federal High Court ruling wey grant di Federal Goment of Nigeria request to name bandits as terrorists for di kontri say e no go get head. ""Declaring di herdsmen banditry as terrorists na just a decision wey dem take for political purpose. E no go get any practical value because even before di declaration, dem bin dey fight and treat dem as terrorists. So na just nomenclature wey I believe say no go change di dynamics on ground. If you fit remember, IPOB, dem also declare am as terrorist organisation, di declaration even dey backed by di order of di Court but as you fit see, even di international community no recognize FG declaration of IPOB. So e don fail to dey effective or to achieve di desired results."" E tok."	NIGERIA	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-59890994
