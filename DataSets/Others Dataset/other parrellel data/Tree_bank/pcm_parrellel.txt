At times, I go too follow some people dey go site, dey do dis labourer work, dey carry help am.

One day, I con tink for myself o mehn.
Dis tin no be di tin wey person go carry become human being for life o.
Because dis tin no be, no be, no be handwork.
Naim I call one of my elder broder wey dey Lagos dat time.
I tell am sey oh boy, man, e dey good meh person dey get just handwork.
At times, make...
If somebody...
Dat handwork, if di school no work out, at least, we go carry dat one dey patch up life.
So e con tell me sey okay make I go make en-... enquiry where, any place wey I go fit learn di work.
So I reach, I start to dey waka di whole street of Gwagwalada dey find where I go make tins, wheder I go learn di work.
So any place where I go, dem go call big money for me, any place where I go, de go call big money for me.
So I come go one place.
So naim I meet di man.
I follow di man talk.
Tell am sey Oga, dis your luck, eh work o, I like am, I wan sabi am.
E say I wan sabi am?
I say yes.
E say okay.
How we go do now?

Dat di amount wey e go carry teach me dis work, na about ten thousand naira.
I say okay no problem!
I go call my people.
We sign abi?
E say I go bring malta, or mineral and biscuit, which I give am.
So at di end of di day, I start to dey learn di work.
When I learn di work, I learn di work a year, and six month.
After I learn di work a year, and six month, I see sey I don sabi di work.
I come call am Oga, di tin wey you go do be sey, now be sey you go free me o.
At least, meh me too become man of myself as you kuma become man of youself dey feed your own family.
E say okay no problem, dat since de, di, my time with you don, don, don do, sey e go settle me.
So I come serve am for some two, or three months before e come settle me making a year, and s-... eight months.
Eh making a year, and eh nine mon-... eh ten months.
So when I se-... e settle, e settle me, I start to dey hustle my own sef dey go site to site.
Upon sey I dey go site to site, me, I tink sey mehn na when you just learn dis our work, you go don become millionaire.
I no know sey when you learn di work sef, hehe comot sef.
Na dere you go know sey dis, dis life ni, dis life no, no, no be small tin.
So na so I start to dey hustle o.
I go go site to site dey tell dem, dey give dem my complimentary card.
Ah I be aluminium technician.
I dey do dis one, I dey design dis window.
I sabi design dis window.
I dey do dis eh eh sliding net, and, and case, casement open, and swing door.
Dem go say okay no problem!
Life for dis our work, no, e no dey easy o.
So di first time I get one contract wey I hit wey dem...
Somebody just call me.
Na my friend papa.
As e call me, thinking maybe as e go help me do sometin, I charge am work say I go do di work almost sixty thousand naira for am (work wey dem dey do hundred thousand) because of hungry.
I say okay bring sixty thousand naira.
To di extend, e give me forty thousand naira.

To di extend, I do di work.

When di man don see sey I don do di work finish, di man swallow di money.
So I look am toh.
Dis one na my friend fader now.
Wetin I go do?
I no go fit follow, follow am go di highest talk.
I look am.
As time goes on, I dey dere dey hustle to site, to site, to site, to site.

At times, di work wey no be my own work sef I go, I go enter am do am in area, in di area to get wetin man go put for bele, wetin man go just carry dey survive, patch up dis life.
Because I see sey dis life, e no dey easy.
Hence man don, God don create man become huma-... man, we get a lot of tins to face, we get a lot of cross to carry.
So na im o.
To di extend sef, even last year sef, where de call me for work, I do di work.
When I do di work finish, di man come tell me sey dat di work wey I do for am, e dey, e get some problem.
To di extend, e wan carry style swallow di money.
I call am.
Oga, di work no do some, no get problem.

To extend sef, e go call some aluminium technician on my back.

So later, e con pay me my money.
Na dat money I come carry do sometin for mysef.

To di extend sef, even recently now sef, e get one of my friend wey don handle one of im site sef for me make I dey manage.

I go do am.
I go do am.

Na im.
Dis life, to become man, e no dey easy.
So dat na some of di interesting part about journalism wey be sey as in de dey talk sey dem say even when you get issue wey you wan discuss, people attitude fit bring out anoda issue wey fit lead to anoda story entirely.
So okay em I remember di time wey America be wan do election.
Dat na two thousand, and eight dat time wey dem go wan...
Obama im contest.
And fortunately, I be one of di journalist wey go cover wetin dey happen for dere.
So as I travel now, I begin, hehe I begin interview one, two, three people.
And I notice sey di issue wey everybody dey discuss, Obama, Obama.
Di young people, dat time, eveybody wey I talk, weda na white, weda na black, weda na Asian, everybody Obama.
But di old people no dey interested.
And I bin even wonder like why?
Why una no dey interested?
Because de say...
E get one old man wey I bin ask, e say e go, e no go make any difference.
Sey na just normal jumpy, jumpy.
Sey everybody just dey happy.
Sey oh new person, black man, and all dose tings!
But at di end of di day, e be like sey most of di old people no just get interest.
Cos de feel say mtschew look we don do dis kind, kind tin before.
Na so e be.
New person go come, everybody go dey shout hey hey hey hosanna, but when matter con be matter, everyting go remain di same.
So I just see sey dat time, a lot of young people dey get interest.
I go New York, I go eh Texas, I go Washington.
Most of di young people wey dey America dat time, de wan vote.
Many of dem, de never vote for deir life before.
So to dem, na interesting opportunity.
Na di first time.
And many of dem wey vote dat time, na because of internet.
Na internet gi-... brin-... ginger dem make dem go vote.
Because before now, many of dem, you know sey na for TV, radio everybody dey talk, but Obama dat time wen e come, na im start dis idea of Facebook campaign.
Vote for me, donate money, support me.
Na everybody, young people, secondary school student, people wey just dey enter university, poly.
Everybody gather.
Na dem give am di vote.
So na dat time I con know sey social media, na powerful tool.
And na one of di tings wey help dat guy win election.
And now, as we see now, everywhere wey we dey go now, social media dey powerful.
Even if you, if you be observe, yesterday, for social media, Facebook, di main ting wey everybody dey talk about, na DNA.
Dna.
D-...
A no know who start dat discussion.
But up till dis morning, everybody don dey talk about am.
Because...
I con ask okay wetin start dat discussion?
Dem say na because one guy con discover sey di four children wey im get no be im own.
And dose children, de don already become adult.
So di debate con start.
Everybody o!
Some, some people dey ask e good make man get, go test im children?
Make e, meh e, meh e be sey na im get dose children?
Some people say na un-African.
No dey do dat kind tin!
Dat it is, e, e, e no dey our culture.
Some people say why, why we no fit do?
So, social media, na very powerful tool wey fit make, or break anybody.
I dey stay with my moder, for village.

But now you know sey sometimes, some, most of dis police, de don dey do all dis eh eh eh eh road, eh transport work ehn all of dem.

Some, some, some of dem good sha, some of dem good!
You wan tell me sey de don dey adjust?
Abeg make I no just spoil my country.
Some of dem good, some of dem good, some of dem good.
But just di ones wey me I don meet now, na fuck up o.
I dey tell di truth.
Dat one no...
If for Naija here, everything ehn, even dat Adigo police wey you dey talk about, na dem dey do you pass sef.
Sometimes, you go dey wonder.
De say police be your friend, be your friend.
Which kind friend?
You know sey e dey, eh e get one, one eh talk wey dem talk sey eh a hungry man is an angry man.
Okay!
Maybe Buhari no wan pay deir, deir salary now.
If dem stand for road, deir eyes red, and you just provoke dem, dem go carry wetin de wan to, slap you, break your motor.
Aha na im.
Person no go just stand for road dey do all dose things, and dem no go get wetin to dey chop, and everything now!
E no good now!
Okay now na, na, na, na now you tanda dey talk, to talk better wey I wan hear.
Aha!
No, no, no!
Even...
No be di one wey you dey talk since o.
Di one wey you don dey talk now, na im be di better.
E don dey flow, e don dey, e don dey flow for di place wey I dey yarn.
Even for eh eh eh eh eh teachers, dem no go wan pay.
If anybody, dem wan respect, any profession for any, anywhere, na teachers de suppose to as in just give as in hm gbosa, as in more than hundred gbosa.
Hm.
Na dem be suppose dey rate pass.
Okay.
De suppose to respect dem pass now.
Okay me, I become doctor, you, you become lawyer, dis person become engineer, who be di person wey train us?
Okay!
Hm!
No be teacher?
Na dem de suppose to pay pass now, but you go go schools, teachers go dey get eh even less dan di money wey de even dey give eh youth corpers.
For why now?
Haba!
E no good, e no good.
Eh babe!
Dem suppose to res-... respect dis teachers.
Babe, make I...
If dem no fit respect teachers, you give dem a better salary, you give dem better house.
Na police, or any oda workers de go dey give?
Hm!
I no know why Nigerians no wan just change o!
You know sey Naija...
And dem go dey talk sey change begins wit, begins with you, and me.
For where?
Dem say charity begins for house.
Which kind charity?
X forget all dose things o!
Me, I don start my charity o!
My charity don begin for house since wey dem born me.
I dey do my charity work, I dey do am.
If na to give pe-... people eh dis thing, if na to respect people, I dey do my charity work.
But make Buhari do im charity, and im change for our own body!
Make di governor, and all of dem do our charity work for our life now abeg!
Leave dat thing!
Dat, dat, dat, dat change wey dem dey talk, no be for everybody o!
Di change wey de dey talk now be sey everything don dey increase.
Dat change...
Hm.
Di thing be sey salary don dey decrease, and di thing wey we come dey buy con dey increase.
Okay.
Increase!
Nothing wey dey hard for her.
I no know.
Haha!
I just tire o.
You know sey I be dey laugh when people dey talk about di change, change, change of a thing.
I be dey tell my mile sey...
My pupsy den con dey dey yarn sey, ah sey ah dis change na for real o, sey Jonathan...
Dat one na di first change wey happen.
Dem wan make Jonathan comot, sey de don tire for Jonathan, sey Jonathan na corruption man.
I tell dem sey no!
De no come ask.
When de dey talk about di change, de no ask sey which kind of change?
You know, change get positive one.
E get better change, e get yeye change.
No be every change be better change o!
Naim de con dey say de wan change.
I say ah!
I just dey look dem.
I say oya moh una go now!
Na today de dey.
Na dem dey follow dey complain.
My, my old, my mile eh, e just dey cry everyday.
I dey laugh am.
My brother, abeg make we just relax!
I say make dem go sit down!
Na Naija matter be dat abeg.
Na God, na God, na God, na God go take control.
Eh Naija matters.
Na wetin, na wetin we don dey talk since.
God go take control.
E no go finish ehn?
Well, bros, as a Warri boy now, di ting be sey di country (di way I dey see am), di country no ge-... e no get any better future for front because di way ting just dey, ting just dey anyhow.
Because normally, de dey, de dey promise us sey dis one go happen, dis one go happen, but all of us don dey wait, noting dey happen.
I fit use my own family as example be sey I remember last time wey de bin call sey de want pay ehn old pensioner someting.
Almost...
Dis one na almost four, to five years now.
We don dey wait.
Noting dey happen.
And most of di ting wey di coun-... di economy dey talk sef, de say tings go better, tings go better, but di ting, everyting just dey go from bad to worst, from fry pan to fire.
But any which way sha, we, all of us, di ting be sey Nigerians, na hard workers we be.
Like recently now, for my area, de just do demolition, and some people just suffer.
De no even warn anybody sey we dey come, moh una pack una tings.
De just con carry everyting down, different houses, even people shop, deir motor.
Di man wey dey drive di demolition motor just carry everyting put underground.
Some people sef even die yesterday sef.
So di ting be sey we, Nigerians wey get dis country, de dey treat us like sey we be foreigner for our own country where my mama born me, and my, my, na here my papa comot from.
E go be like sey na foreigner I be.
E be like sey na, I, I smuggle mysef enter di country, but meanwhile, na me get country, na me be my...
I be citizen.
So serious one be sey make government stop all dese deir promises, meh dem try work out someting for us, di origi-... or, or, ehn ordinary Nigerians so dat make small tings tay dey reach our hands.
Because if person do bad ting now, de go say person don thief, but if person hustle, de go dey bring us go back to square one.
So at least, make government try do someting any which way.
Ehn for me sha, wetin me, I go not like government make do sey make government try small, make dem create small, small opportunities for people.
At least, even if na...
Because di time wey...
I hear sey di time wey Buhari say e wan enter government, im talk sey im go dey give every graduate five, five k, or some amount of money wey go take start business.
So dat kind ting go make sense so dat di country go move forward small.
Because everybody dey say idle man is a devil's workshop.
Person wey sit down one place now, e go dey tink of how to take thief, or how to take kidnap person, and na wetin wesef no want.
So make government try take, put some revenue inside make person take see food chop.
Because sometime, some family sef, na hungry dey kill dem.
And de say de wan make di country fine meh better, but, di government no dey do anyting.
Instead, you go dey hear sey dis one thief, dis one...
Dis one say e wan return dis one, dis one do dis one.
But na we wey dey, na we dey suffer am pass, we wey dey underground.
So make government try.
Dat'S why we vote dem in.
De suppose dey protect us.
Make dem try cover us up.
Make dem put small, some small tings for us.
Even if na to give us small money, moh take start business, or do someting.
E for make sense dan dis one wey people go dey do tings by demsef.
At di end, de go still con come comot am from ground.
Ehn di incident wey I be face when I small na when ehn de bin sack my mama from work di time wey I dey school.
Because my mama bin hustle small money send me abroad now go learn small ting.
So naim dey con...
My moder con call me sey de don drop dem from work o.
Sey de dey find fresh blood, de dey wan new people.
So de con sack di old one witout giving dem anyting.
De just drop dem like dat.
Sey money never come dis one.
Dat was even before Goodluck enter power o.
Even till now sef, we still dey wait.
De dey say de go dey call.
Every, everytime de call, de talk sey de wan collect names.
So-... sotay some of her colleagues sef, some don even die.
Some no even know...
We no even know where some dey.
So di ting be sey many of us, Nigerians don suffer to make dis country go where e go.
Wetin be sey none of us dey, dey, dey ev-... none of us dey...
Government dey look.
Ah for some countries now (like London now), de dey pay old citizens.
People wey don stay di country well, well, de dey give dem small allowances because de know sey de no fit too hustle like dat.
So if government go fit, even if no be allowances, make dem pay people wetin de owe dem.
Like deir fees, and money wey de suppose to give dem.
Pension money, dat ting go do.
E go go long way because most people, na wetin de dey depend on.
So na just wetin I just dey beg government meh dem try do be dat.
Make government try hustle out small ting because we sef, we dey suffer well, well.
Na we dey face am pass.
If anyting increase (di fuel increase, or oders increase), na di poor man dey suffer am because rich man get money pass us.
Because for Nigeria, e be like sey na di poor ones dey get poor pass, and di rich ones, na im e con get money pass.
Because e be like sey everyting just dey go from bad to worst.
So make government don try.
Because no be only me, many of my mate too sef.
Like yesterday, one of my friend wey we dey stay for di same area, bulldozer come con scatter di shop wey im mama take dey sell food.
And na from dere de dey chop.
Just scatter di food, even scatter plus cooler, and di fridge join.
And after, de go say we are one Nigeria.
So dat kind ting no make sense now.
Even if de wan comot person from where e dey, de go first warn am first meh e comot.
No be sey de will just come con dey do anyhow because de get power.
Because now for Nigeria, e be like sey poor people no get right.
And e no make sense because all of us na one Nigeria.
So de for don try small ting just tay arrange person.
But meh, meh poor people, meh people no con turn to di side of crime now, con dey do wetin e no make sense now.
So na wetin I just dey beg di government meh dem don dey useful.
Make dem not just sit down dere dey talk about twenty thirteen budget when we dey twenty seventeen.
Make de dey take di future small, small.
Make dem no dey take am too far.
Because na we dey suffer am pass abeg.
Dis story wen I wan give now, na about my own life experience.
My papa, and mama dey...
Dem na from Etsako in Edo State for inside Nigeria wey dem give birth to me.
As dem give birth to me, no be me alone dem give birth to o.
We be eight in number.
We con be six boys, and two girls.
In process, as person dey grow for life, di life, e full of different challenges sha o.
Though na God na im dey see us through.
When we dey grow up, as young children, our parents give us, give birth to us strong, and healthy, and we dey grow up well.
Play go outside, play come house, go school, come back.
One fateful day, den when I don reach seven years, wen I take go school we don dey write our final exam to go to di next class.
I dey primary two then to go to primary three.
I no finish my exam.
Na dere I for con sick come house.
De con rush me come house.
Ah!
When my mama con see how my body be, say no, dis one no be di one (though my papa travel, e no dey around), sey no be di one wen e go take put me for house dey do self medication.
She con swing into action.
With her oder neighbour, de con carry me go specialist hospital.
When we reach dere, de say no ah dis one na admission straight o.
De con put me for admission.
Con do series of operation even before my papa con come from journey.
As im come from journey say body give am sign, naim come back.
Con really see sey ah me dey on admission.
We con try o, battle o for almost a year for dat specialist.
When de wan con do renovation, de con refer me to UBTH.
Sey no o, make I con go UBTH!
So I con dey UBTH.
Ubth con still put me on admission, con do series of operation for my body.
Con...
De try sha.
Sey de fit revive me back to life.
At di end of di day, even me on my sick bed, I no even dey pray to even live because di pain wen I dey pass through at dat time dey too much, dey terribly bad.

You know, I no find my healing for di herbalist place.

Dis soup, di soup wey I wan teach una how to cook, na egusi soup.
How dey take dey cook egusi soup be sey you go bring out your egusi, you go grind am.
Mtschew!
If you grind am finish, you fit use...
Some dey use grinding stone grind am, some dey use me-... eh grinding machine grind am, some dey use blender dey grind am.
Anyone wey you provided, di egusi smooth.
If e don smooth, don turn powder, you turn am put inside bowl, you put am inside rubber.
You turn am put inside rubber.
When you don put am inside di rubber, you add small water, you turn am.
You fit put pepper inside.
You put pepper inside, slice your onions put inside.
Some of dem dey like to fry am while some people no dey like.
Some dey like to fry, some no dey like to fry am.
But I wan tell you di one wey de, you...
Ehn na di frying aspect own na im I wan tell you so.
Di frying aspect be sey as you put am inside bowl, you turn am finish.
You put di eh onions inside di ma-... eh inside di egusi.
You turn, eh you, you put di, eh slice onions put.
You stir am finish.
After you don stir am finish, you turn am put inside di hot oil.
But you no go wait meh di oil bleach before you turn everything put.
When you don turn am inside, put inside di ho-... eh hot oil, you con still dey turn am so that e no go burn.
You go still dey turn am, dey turn until eh egusi don change colour.
Once e don change colour inside dat pot, e don change colour small, you don see di cu-... di co-... eh difference in colour finish, den, you go con add water.
If na meat water, if na meat water, you add, you pour am inside.
Once you don pour di meat water inside di, di, inside di soup, you go con turn am small.
Leave am make e boil.
But before e go boil, you go don put all your maggi, your salt, your crayfish.
If na dawadawa you get, you turn am put.
Once you don put am finish, e don boil finish, den you put your meat.
If di meat never soft, you put am dat period wey be sey you dey put all your ingredients so dat everyting go boil together.
Once everything don boil together, everything don boil finish, before you go con add.
If na bitter leaf you get o, you wan put inside, you put, if na pumpkin leaf you wan put inside, you put inside.
Den, you put salt.
Den you leave am make e boil.
If e don boil well, e don boil well, well, as you see am say e dey boil well, well, you taste am.
If di taste st-... if di taste ni, e no meet up to di taste wey you want, you still add.
If na salt never dey am, you add small salt join am.
Den when e don boil finish, you bring am down.
If na garri you wan use eat, eh you wan use take am, use garri.
If eh dat's eba, you use eba.
If na pounded yam you wan use, you use pounded yam.
If na semo, you use semo, or amala.
Anyone, any food wey you wan use eat am, na you fit use am eat.
Di soup wey I like to cook, na im be banga soup.
Because banga na natural oil.
Na im dey banga.
To cook banga soup, you go fit remove oil keep for inside.
If you wan use di oil, go let you use!
And banga na soup wey be sey e good for body.
Even our doctors nowadays, dem dey encourage us make we dey cook am.
So I go teach una di method to take cook di banga.
Once you don b-... buy your banga for market, make sure sey you wash am very well.
Or maybe na your backyard you for cut am.
Make sure sey you wash am very well.
You put am for pot.
E done.
If di banga don done, you self go dey hear di aroma sey di thing don done.
Once e don done, for twenty, or twenty five minutes, you go remove am.
You go pound am for mortar.
When you pound am for mortar, you go make sure sey all di kanda, di edge, eh di back shell wey you pound, all smooth.
Because if e no smooth, di oil no go come out very well.
But if e smooth, you go fit get your oil, and di flavour wey you dey find for inside.
So once you don pound am very well for mortar, den you go filter am with hot water.
Some, de go say de no want make di thing too dey watery.
But by di time wey you go use enough water take filter am well, na im di thing go come out well.
Ehen!
Dough banga soup dey take eh time o.
If na fire wood now, you go know sey yes e go quick.
Di soup go quick thick.
But if na gas, if na stove, go ready to use enough gas, and enough kerosine.
But dat one no mean.
For us to arrive at our normal result, na, na im make am.
Because if you no use hot water take rinse am well, di banga go still follow di kernel comot, and dat one na, na waste.
So you need to use hot water take wash am well.
You go take your time.
So if na meat you wan use take cook am, if na fresh fish, if na, if na ponmo, e go even good because before ponmo go even done for fire, di soup go don thick.
But if na meat, e still good.
If na fresh fish, you go know sey di ban-... di soup go don thick small before you put your fresh fish.
Shey we know sey our fresh fish na, e no get power.
Under five, or ten minutes, e don done.
So anyone wey we wan use inside all dis eh eh meat, we go use am.
Take do, eh take cook di soup so dat di thing go dey thick.
Den if na starch you wan take eat am o if na semo o but according to banga soup sha, na starch na im go wit am so dat e go dey well.
Some go say de no like starch.
Di way dem dey turn am wey be sey e dey, e dey draw.
But me, I wan tell una sey if una dey turn dat starch, if una put salt, if you dey cut am for plate, e go dey very, very easy to cut.
Now those wey be sey dem go say dem no dey eat salt (e no mean sey you no dey eat salt, but at least, if na pinch of salt, you go put am inside) take turn di starch so dat e go let you eat.
To train pikin for fashion, we go first interview di person to know where e go school reach.
Why we dey interview am?
Make we wey we be di sewing mistress, meh we know where we for start with dat person.
Because if na who go school, na small work na im we go do follow di person.
But if e no go school, na im be sey we go start from di grassroot.
Because who go school, to pedal machine, e no go hard am.
Because dat one na di first process.
We go teach am to pedal.
And dis pedaling of machine now, na two ways.
We go pedal go front, we go pedal go back.
Dat back own no be am at all.
Dat one dey break needle.
But if you dey pedal go front, you go know sey yes you dey di line.
And who go school now, you go know sey yes na front im dey pedal come.
But who no go school, e go just dey pedal for pedaling sake.
But if you look am, you go know sey na back na im dey pedal go.
And dat back wey im dey pedal go, e no go fit sew.
But if e dey pedal come front, you go know sey yes, na make up.
Person be sey im go school, to pedal, e no go hard am.
But if e no go school, we wey be sewing mistress, we go need to take time to sit down for machine.
As we dey pedal, e go dey look our leg.
E go know sey na front na im we dey pedal go.
But who go school, we no need all dose process for am.
Na just to give am one machine say take, dey pedal!
And if you give am one machine, we go need to remove di needle.
Why we dey remove di needle wey dey be sey so dat e no go crack dat needle because if we no remove di needle, if e crack dat needle we put thread we dey sew, our sewing, our stitching no go fine at all.
Na im make us dey remove di needle.
But person wey be sey e go school, e dey pedal come front, na small work na im we go do for dat person body.
We just take dat pedaling work.
Just, if na person wey clever well, well, we, eh to teach am pedaling work, maybe a week.
But who no go school, eh a month, we go still dey teach am how to pedal.
Be like pikin wey newly dey grow, dey teach am how to eat ehn solid food.
No be milk, no be custard again.
So meh we see...
Na im make us dey ask di level wey di person go school reach before we know how to go in detail wid am for dis our fashion work.
But if e don sabi pedal now, na be sey we go give am cement paper, or brown paper, we go put am for needle meh e take dey sew wid needle.
If e dey sew straight, you go know sey if you give am cloth as sample, e go fit sew straight.
But if e no sew straight, you go know sey if you give am cloth, or pieces sey make e take sew, e no go fit sew well.
So na im be di thing.
My women, una good afternoon o.
I wish una safe delivery.
I want talk to una about immunisation.
Meh una no vex o.
I go take part of una time.
I wan tell una about immunisation because some women dey here.
Na village na im dem dey.
De go go farm.
De no know wetin dem dey call immunisation.
But e good make we let una know wetin be immunisation.
Immunisation na when you born pikin, you carry am go hospital, go give am injection.
If we will look our world wey we dey nowadays, if you born pikin, you never give am immunisation (like BCG now, na im be di first one wey you go first take), if you never give am BCG, anoder person no go fit carry am apart from only you.
But if you don give am BCG now, every other person go fit still carry am.
Dat one na di first one wey you first give am just after you born am finish.
Den e still get di one wey de still give her again after one month.
If e don complete one month, you go give am for im hand.
Dat one you go give am for hand so.
If any sickness dey come, di pikin go fit withstand am.
Because all dis immunisation wey we dey talk so, if we no give our pikin, na im make am some go born, dem go say after some time, di pikin die.
Dem no know wetin kill di pikin.
All dis one, na im be wetin dey...
Na all dis na im be wetin make us say e good make we immunise our pikin.
If we look dis immunisation, pikin dey take immunisation go reach nine months, a year.
Even ehn dis ehn polio wey e dey waka wey be sey pikin go you go born pikin, e no go quick waka!
You go born pikin, e go be like imbecile.
Na advantage of...
When you go immunize, immunize our pikin, all dese sickness no go near dat pikin.
Na wetin I wan tell una be dat.
Una do well.

So as you open your door meh de enter so, e be sey you accept peace, and you accept di God of peace, and peace go dey your house.
So for di following year so you don ready settle your peace.
So everybody go quick dey open door.
De go come inside, begin sprinkle di water di leaf.

You go dey carry all di children come.
De go dey sprinkle di water.
Di leaf, everybody go (even if na one you see), go hang am for your door where all di evil spirit go dey see am.

Different, different area ehen.
So maybe people from di palace or, de go come, de go dey spread di thing.
So e dey very interesting.
Dat one na di very early morning of di day of di festival.
Den e get some rituals wey Oba go perform for palace (you know) by noon time, by afternoon time.
So everybody go con begin kill deir goat.
E get some kind incantation, some kind ting wey de go do.

Na dat one dey sweet me pass.
Con begin serve food, carry go give relations, go give friends, neighbours.
And you know, dat time wey we small, any pikin wey carry food come your house like dat, you go must give am money.
So we dey like to do dat one well, well because di number of house wey you carry food go you go...
Na im be sey, di money wey you go collect dat day no be small.
So food go berekete.
We go chop well, well.
And relations wey come from different, different places (you know), de go dey around.

Den di Oba of Benin go, go address di people dose wey go palace o.
Go address dem you know.
Tell di people how to, how we go take behave, even di kind tins wey we go do so dat eh di gods no go dey angry with us.
You know, all dose kind things.
Dat period eh, no market go open o.
Nobody go, nobody go...
In fact, na even against di law sef sey you go go open market, sey you dey sell one thing.
All shops, everywhere, e go close down yes so dat e want to, you want respect di gods for dat period eh.
But dese days now ah, Church don dey preach against all dose kind tins o.
Ehen.
Church don dey preach against.
De say all dose kind tins na, na ritual, na Devil.
Na im people dey use all dose kind tin dey serve.
So as people don dey become Christian now, so di festival no dey carry like dat again.
But de still dey do am o.
De still dey do am.
Every year, de must do am.
So na so di festival be very, very, very interesting.
Ah if, if you, if, if, if you want witness am eh, during dat kind twenty seven twenty eight, just come Benin.

Very interesting.
Masquerade sef, de dey come outside.
Eh now!
You go, you fit come now, no problem.
Masquerade go come outside.
Ah de go dey dance.
But women no dey near masquerade o.
No o.
If you near masquerade for Benin lands, as a woman, de fit flog you.
So na taboo for woman to go.
So na from distance na im, na im women dey look dem.
Ehen but men fit go near dem.
So because de dey see dose eh masquerade as eh di representative...
De dey see dem as spirit.
Eh de see dem as di god, di spirit wey di gods send come con take bless us.
So we no fit just go near dem.
Ah de respect dem well, well.
So once di masquerade dance come out like dat, you go see people go dey throw money give dem.
De trow money give dem.
As de dey throw money give dem so, e be sey de dey ask for prayer, de dey ask for blessing.
Tings don so hard sotay if man, and woman like each oda, con tell each oda sey we go marry tomorrow o, na only me you go dey follow o, no follow anoda person o, na lie!
E no dey work like dat.
Dat agreement wey me and you get so, one of us go go back go scatter am now.
Ehen me, na now me know di question wey you dey ask.
Now wetin you want know be dat sey why de go con go scatter am?
Good.
You see ehn first place wey we dey so, make I first talk man own.
Why man go dey go dey cheat on women?
You see men, as you dey see dem so, de too dey get bad, bad friends.
I no dey talk to una.
And di friends dem so ehn, e, dem dey mislead dem.
So dose ones, even pastor wey you dey see so, wey dey go church so, some yeah dey dere.
Yes o!
When dem don go meet demself dey talk for back, one pastor go tell di oda one sey hm you know sey we be human being, so God dey understand.
Den you wey never do am before, you go con look am sey na true sha, no be big ting, na small sin.
So dem dey influence each oda.
Na im dey make...
Hm na wetin me, I see o!
Men dey cheat because sey di circle of friends wey dem dey follow dey waka, de no see am as big deal sey you no stay with one woman.
In fact, e go be like sey you stupid sef.
For di kind generation wey we dey now, sey you dey follow only one woman, you no get shortcut (de dey call am shortcut, hm), sey you no get shortcut, you go be like wetin?
You be Jesus?
Na so de dey...
And na wetin me dey see o!
Hm!
So de dey...
Di cheating wey dey go on so now ehn, from men side, na di kind friends wey dem get na im dey teach dem how to cheat.
And I mean am sotay reach sey even dose wen dey go church.
If you no still get better friend, you go still go church (you know), you go still cheat.
Hm mtschew dis my broda, you, you open, you sabi so?
You dey waka?
You no dey waka, e be like sey you no dey see road!
You no dey see road.
Meh dey see road o!
Men dey cheat up and down.
Women dey cheat o, but na men own plenty pass.
And I dey tell you di reasons why dem dey cheat.
Hm?
Because sey deir friends dey encourage dem.
De no get friends wen go tell dem sey e dey very bad.
In fact deir friends go make am look like sey you no know what's up if you no dey cheat.
How you go just say only one woman, na im you go just dey follow?
Dat na big problem wey dey make cheating dey, dey happen for relationship.
Den di oda one wey con dey happen be sey women sef, dem bad.
Na we dey do ourselves.
If not, if man con meet secretary, and secretary know sey madam dey always come see oga, e mean sey you know sey dis oga get wife.
How come when oga con begin dey cut eye for you, con begin dey toast you, you sef, you gree?
You no suppose to gree so.
Apart from sey men, deir eye no done (na so we dey talk am for Pidgin o, deir eye no done, dem no get better friend), we, women sef, we bad.
We dey do oursefs.
Because if you say you no gree, di man go go.
But if you gree, ehen parade don start.
Yes o!
Na you call am business, na parade I call am.
Ehen!
Den, you see dis cheating wey we dey talk so ehn mtschew, culture dey bad.
For dis Nigeria wey me and you dey so, if I dey go out with your brother, your brother cheat, I con report am give you, you know wetin you go tell me now.
Ha!
You go tell me sey weda na because of only me dem circumcise am?
One woman don tell one girl like dat sey why you'll say make e no follow anoda woman?
Na because of only you I circumcise my pikin?
So culture sef e no help matter at all.
You go go report give mama, mama go tell you sey why, make my pikin taste!
Or na taste dem dey call am o!
Make e taste oda women.
Hm na so!
Den you see dis cheating, na men own I dey talk o!
Women own eh, e plenty.
Hm!
Den you see dis cheating wey men dey cheat so, some women get money.
De dey take am catch men like dis.
Dem go buy dem.
But man wey you know sey don marry, im wife dey manage, when e tell you sey e want do birthday, you go go buy am Ipad, and di, all dose big, big tings wey you take am do gifts.
Di long throat man now go con begin dey say madam thank...
Madam, madam go soon start to become your name.
E go con start to dey call you your name.
Eh Titi, eh thank you for dat yesterday.
From dere, bad, bad tings dey happen.
So because of sey men greedy, de dey find where sweet.
Di wife for house no dey fit buy dem Ipad during birthday.
Rich, rich women wey dey find how dem go just take begin dey make men sleep wit dem, if dem see you say dem like you, de go begin buy big, big ting dey give you.
So indiscipline!
I call dat one indiscipline.
Apart from greed on di part of di man, na indiscipline.
Good!
Den my own o, finally o, di women for house, di wife for house, de dey make some men dey cheat.
We know oursefs.
Some men, as you dey see dem so, dem no dey fit keep body.
Dem dey like make body dey touch body.
But you see some of us, women, hm na dat time we go talk sey we get headache, we no well, we do dis, we do dat.
Ah!
Where man go come, e go come.
You, only you go con open your mouth, tell am sey abeg sex na food?
Le-... leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone.
No be so.
Di man go go cheat o!
So we, di women wey dey house, wey be di wives eh, hm we dey contribute to why men dey cheat.
And some of wo-... some women sef dirty!
Heh!
Mtschew oh Jesus!
You...
Man wey im secretary for house dey use deodorants, dey use perfume, dey use swe-... strong, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet smelling tings, you, you dey house since morning, you never even brush mouth.
Amawe to bath.
When di man go come house, you go con expect sey na you wan enter im...
If you see di short, short skirt wey dis children dey wear nowadays ehn, dem be witch o!
Dose girls, ah hm dem be better witch.
But if di woman for house sef try, no fat full everywhere!

Dem dey call am package.
Package yourself well!
Ehn no I no dey humhum!
Package yourself well!
E-... e-... e-...
Some men dey even like make women get body.
Dem dey call dose kind women grab someting women.
Ah mah I grab someting!
Yes so di woman go try make she...
If you get body, dey package am well!
Di man go dey like am.
Den on di part of di women, why dem dey cheat?
Hm!
You see women ehn, as you dey see dem dere so ehn, hai!
Hm!
How I wan take talk am o?
Small ting no dey reach dem!
Since we go university together, dis my husband, e never buy me phone one day.
Na kpalasa phone.
Meanwhile, dat my friend, im husband buy am dis, e buy am dat.
E dey, dey, e dey worry deir brain.
Deir brain no dey, e no dey twist for right place.
En na greed.
I talk am.
Greed dey worry women well, well.
You go still call am indiscipline.
You go still call am...
How I wan take even describe am?
So dose kind women ehn, small opportunity like dis, dem go cheat on di man o!
Wheda you don marry am for house sef, or una still dey date, de go cheat on di man.
You dey understand me so my broda?
Den you see women wey you dey see dere so ehn?
Hm!
Men, as dem be so ehn, we dey call dem predators.
Predators!
Dem go...
Yes o!
Once de don see woman wey dem like like dis, de fit turn di heaven, and earth upside down.
Must, de must get dat woman, de must get dat woman.
So e go take di grace of God for wo-... wo-... woman wey man talk sey I must get you like dis, e go take di grace of God make you no fall.
Because...
Eh wetin?
I dey talk to you?
So because dat man, ehen e go study you, study everyting.
Your...
E go understand wetin you dey suffer, wetin you dey lack.
E go con begin dey give you.
Meh God come catch you!
Your husband for house sef, e come dey misbehave, or na one kind yeye man, you go just fall.
E get many tings wen I no dey like for many people body.
But to tell you dis kind of tings sey...
Except I wan call di person name.
But e no good make person dey call person name.
So I go tell you one story.
Dis story, de tell me when I dey primary school.
And na Pidgin de take tell me di story.
And I go try remember everyting wey happen for di story as di guy take talk am.
But dat guy, e sabi talk story well, well.
Dat guy, I dey admire am when we dey primary school dat time.
Im say e wan tell us one story, make all of us listen.
Naim e con start.
E con say story, story.
We con say story!
Story, story!
Story.
E say di title of di story wen e wan tell us, na di story of Alaska Pepper.
Aha who be dis Alaska Pepper?
Why e get name like Alaska Pepper?
Pepper even dey di name.
E say make we listen, meh we keep quiet, make e tell us dis story.
Sey Alaska Pepper na one small boy.
Nobody like Alaska Pepper for di area where de dey stay.
For dat area, Alaska Pepper dey always dey cause trouble.
Anyting wey de do bad, you go call Alaska Pepper name inside.
If you see pot for ground, pot wey e moko, pot wey e don dent, you know sey na Alaska Pepper na im cause am.
If you see pot wey e break, you go know sey na Alaska Pepper cause am.
Anywhere trouble dey waka follow, na dat kind place na im Alaska Pepper dey go.
So people no con like am.
So Alaska Pepper dey always do, do tings wey people no dey like for dat community.
But Alaska Pepper, na one kind person wey e be sey people no like.
But e get some kind tings wey dey, wey e dey work for inside Alap-... Alaska Pepper mind.
So for dat town where de dey, e get di days wey e dey, de dey call deir market days.
Women, everybody for different, different village, de go carry deir different, different tings.
Cassava, pepper, garri, ehn different tings, de go carry am put for head.
De go go one market.
Dat market, na Agbadu Market.
Before de go reach dere, some will cross Ikpoba, Ikpoba River before de go reach dere.
Some people dey come from anoda place wey de dey call Enyan.
For different, different place, go come gada for dat market.
So e get one period wey di market go start in di morning.
Na evening na im people go take comot dere.
Because people dey use leg dose days dey travel go di place.
De go comot early morning for house, and once de don reach dere, den de go con shade all di tings wey de carry come.
Den people con stay, con start to dey buy.
So na dat kind place na im Alaska Pepper (dat kind place where dat market dey, Agbadu), na im Alaska Pepper for grow.
Na im de know sey Alaska Pepper no be better pikin.
Sey na bad, bad tings, and bad, bad boys na im Alaska Pepper dey follow.
So e get one ting wey e con happen.
Nobody know wetin call, to call, to call di ting.
One kind ojuju just dey come out from inside bush.
Because dat period, e be like sey de wan con do one big festival for Benin.
So people con dey really dey come market.
Children dey follow deir papa, and deir mama dey come market.
So dis kind period, di ojuju go just come out from bush.
E go see pikin, e go carry am.
Aha people con dey wonder sey three people go market, only two go come back.
Anoda, ehn anoda, four people...
Two women go go, maybe one person, no, na im go come back.
De con dey carry di story dey go palace.
De carry am go everywhere o.
Con see wetin dey happen o!
E be like sey someting dey happen to us anytime wey we go market.
When we go market, one person no go come back.
Naim di, di king con say im don hear di matter, im go do someting.
So di king con call everybody come.
All di elders, con tell dem sey una see wetin our people dey complain sey market no dey let de go again.
Because e con be like sey because di ting con dey happen well, well, de no con dey go market X, like de dey go market before.
So some people con dey go house.
When dat market day reach, de go find how de go do deir tings.
Some people, deir tings con dey rotten for farm.
De no con dey carry am go market.
So naim di king con talk sey e know wetin e go do.
E con say make all im best eh, im best eh soldiers, make de go di market.
So soldiers go con go di market.
De go con dey wait make di animal come.
So as di animal go come, when di animal go see sey na soldier, e no see all dose people, e go first dey go.
When animal con see sey na soldier, soldier dey come, animal con, di animal con catch one.
When de go shoot di, ehen di animal bow, and arrow, di ojuju wey dey come out...
A don dey call am animal now.
I go tell you why I dey call am animal.
Because nobody fit describe am.
Because im head, e be like cow head, im leg, e get tail like monkey, im hand, e be like sey na e be like human being hand, im body, e be like, be like sey na pig body.
So di only way wey you fit take describe am na sey di animal na ojuju.
So di ojuju dey catch people dat time.
So when di soldiers wey di king send wan shoot, who send am, send wan shoot di ting bow, and arrow, di ting no go enter.
E go fall troway.
So nobody fit kill am.
So once e catch one, di ting go carry di person enter bush.
So some people con go meet native doctor.
De con do strong medin wetin we dey call jazz.
So de go con do am, con put am for deir gun.
De go shoot di ting, di ting no go enter, di bullet go fall for ground.
So when dat kind ting con dey happen, people go con dey run, de con dey try different, different method.
Some people go use cutlass.
De go sharp di two side of di cutlass, chook di ting.
De go chook am put, di ting no go, e no go enter.
De say which kind ting be dis?
So naim di king con call everybody back, con say see o, dat time, im be send only im soldier, sey now, anybody, if you be hunter, anyting wey you be, meh you try!
If you fit kill, if you fit kill dis, kill dis animal, sey see di, see di big ting wey e go do for you.
So e con tell de sey one kind big land, plus one of im, im pikin, im daughter, na im go carry give di person.
So naim de con say okay.
So naim different, different people, de con form different group.
Some hunter group, some soldier group, some, eh some area boys group.
All of dem con form.
Even Alaska Pepper too, con get ambition say im too go fit kill dis eh, dis ojuju wey nobody don fit kill.
So because di ting dey only come out for market day, so everybody con ready.
De con go look for dis animal.
De con look for am.
Some con pass bush, some con pass road, some pass back of market.
De con dey look for di animal.
When time con reach when di animal dey come out, e con come out.
Everybody con dey try different tings, try, try different tings.
E no work.
Di animal con still carry di one wey e wan carry enter bush.

For inside barrack here, in di morning, if I wake up, I go bath my pikin, I go put food for fire.
If she don chop, wey she don bath, wey she don dress for school, she go go school.
So I go con dey do house work.
And again, I dey do tailoring work.
For I just newly come inside barrack here, so I never too get customer wey plenty.
So in di...
If she don go school finish, I go...
If I don sweep house, do everytin, all my house work, I don do am finish, di little one, di little cloth wey I get, I go sew.
Because na every month na im de dey, na im de dey pay for inside, na im dem dey pay for soldier.
Una know sey na soldier wife I be.
So di little cloth wen I get, I go sew am.
If month end, de go con give me money.
Di ones wey no fit pay di full money, de go pay half.
I go collect am.
Di kind cloth wey I dey sew, I dey sew iro, and buba, I dey sew gown, I dey sew skirt, and blouse.
E depend on style wey de say dem, dem want.
And e depend on di money wey you talk sey you go, you go pay.
So, for inside barrack here, di life for inside barrack here too, no too dey easy, but we just tank God sey tins go better one day for inside barrack here.
I get many neighbours o!
See my, our house!
Our house long well, well.
I get many neighbours.
One name na Mama Piriye, one name na Mama Umi.
She dey sell pepper.
Dem, for down here, de dey sell fish.
E no need make you even climb because na on top, up, up we dey live.
E no even need meh you climb up, en go down.
If you wan climb, you fit put doro.
If you wan buy fish, de go sell, de go put di tin inside doro for you, de go send am up.
For inside barrack here, we no...
We, people, di wife wey dey house here, we no too get work.
Na house we dey dey.
Until, if our husband come back, now we dey get money.
After, en sometimes, wey I dey go inside, (de dey do hair for mami) I go go do my hair for mami, for eh mami, place wey soldier wife dey sell sometin.
I go go do my hair for inside mami.
And if month, ehn if month end, if we wan go, if we wan go collect mo-... if we wan go buy food for house, we go go dis thing, we go go Bodija, one market dere.
We go go dere, we go go buy something, for house.
We go go buy something, we go go buy foodstuff for, from market.
We dey...
We dey even follow bush.
Shortcut dey.
We go follow bush.
If you no wan follow (because transport to go outside from, for here to go Bodija, I go use seventy naira con go outside barrack), you go use anoda seventy naira, abi fifty naira go Bodija.
So e d-... e dey easy for us.
We go just follow shortcut inside bush here.
We just cross dis express, go just enter thirty naira.
We don enter inside Bodija.
So na so we dey.
We are...
We dey always get light too.
Light dey always dey inside barrack here.
If, except dis few days now wey rain, wey breeze blow well, well, so our light spoil.
We no get light.
So we dey always get light.
And water no dey dis barrack at all.
We dey suffer for water.
Di only time wey we dey get water well, well, if na rainy season.
If rain don fall, everybody go put im drum outside, but if rain no fall, we no dey, we dey always suffer for water.
Our tank, dem do tank for us here because na g-... ehn group by group.
Mp dey, Sergeant ehn, S, and T dey, Medical dey.
Dem get deir bore, but our own here, our new, our commandant, e no gree repair am for us.
E spoil am.
And we go fetch water for di oder block.
Dem no gree.
De say de no wan moh fetch water for our, for deir place.
Sey moh dey go our place.
So since den, we suffer for, for water.
We go find water, find water, no go see.
We dey always suffer for water.
And again, deir life for inside barrack here, e, e just dey easy.
Moh no talk.
E dey...
B-... but I prefer di time wen I still dey Ondo State dere.
Dat place, everything dey okay.
Water dey, everything dey, market dey.
But when dem talk sey person now, by force by fire, you go go your husband house, go go husband house, you need to stay with your husband because dem no fit leave soldier man like dat, person come here.
But dat place, I still prefer dat place.
Make I stay for dat place.
But as life dey goes on now!
I dey go Redeem Church.
My church here na after dis Ojurin side dere for inside barrack here.
Na Redeem I dey go.
I dey go dere.
We dey...

On Sunday, na nine clock de start programme.
De go finish twelve.
Because of sey ehn maybe all di people wey dey go duty, meh dem fit meet programme, na nine o'clock de dey start.
And Bible study dey, deep dey.
We go go...
Sometimes, once in a month, de will always get night vigil.
De attend night vigil because of sey dem no wan too much noise for, inside barrack.
So dat is why de dey do deir programme like dat.
Born anoda one, na only dat one na im I still get for hand.
But all di children around me, na still my pikin na im de, dem be.
My people, I welcome una to dis Sunday o.
As e be so, una see sey we don enter di season of Lent.
And di season of Lent, as we talk for Ash Wednesday, na di season of preparation for di glorious passion of our Lord.
On Ash Wednesday, we tell una sey dis time na time of fasting, na time of alms giving, na time of prayer.
Dose na di three pillars of Lent.
And as we do for una for Ash Wednesday so, una receive ashes for forehead.
Di ashes na to show una sey una dey mourn for sin o.
No be sey una put di ashes for forehead begin dey fight.
And na so Prophet Joel tell us sey make we render our hearts not our garments.
And if we look the reading today so, you go see sey temptation go even plenty for dis time of Lent well, well.
If we look Jesus, e go desert.
E fasted for forty days, for forty nights.
E faced temptation after.
Dat na to show us wetin Hebrew four fifteen tell us.
Sey Jesus, dem tempt am like us.
But im own, e no sin.
Because no be sey e bad make person dey tempted.
All of us go face temptation.
Di bad side na when you fall into di temptation.
And e get di way wey God take dey give us grace o.
God dey give us power make we take overcome our temptation.
E con depend on us whether we wan use di power, or we no wan use di power.
But di power dey.
Because God no go give us temptation wey go pass our power.
Dey give us di temptation wey be sey we go fit get di power to overcome.
If we look Jesus so, Satan tempt am for three areas.
E tempt am for pleasure, e tempt am for power, e tempt am for money.
Who no like pleasure?
Everybody like pleasure so now.
If you look ehm, if...
When Satan tempt her, Satan tell am sey if you pluck di fruit, sey di fruit go sweet.
Sey Eve go be like God.
E go fit know wetin good, e go fit know wetin evil.
Who no wan be like God?
Eve look di fruit like dis.
As e look am, e say, e say e sweet.
See sey di ting dey pleasurable.
E chop am.
Na hunger now, na hunger issue.
Di same Satan con meet Jesus.
E say you don dey fast since, you need to turn stone to bread now, make you fit chop.
Who no wan chop food?
But Jesus tell am.
E say get behind me Satan.
No be so?
Part of di temptation wey una dey face na issue of hunger now.
You dey hungry.
You fit do anyting for food.
But Jesus say make you no do anyting for food.
E say you go fit tell Satan sey get behind me, sey God get power pass you.
Den make we go di issue of power.
Who no like power?
Everybody like power.
Husband want get power over di wife, wife want get power over di husband.
No be wetin we dey hear for news today?
People dey kill for power, people dey do so many tings for power.
No be one woman stab her husband di oder day so?
Sey di husband no dey do well, well.
Everybody wan power now.
And Satan even know sey Jesus as human being wan power.
E tell am.
E say climb di mountain so, jump down.
You go fit show everybody sey you get power if you fit jump down from dat high mountain.
But Jesus tell am di same ting.
E said get behind me Satan, you shall not tempt di Lord, your God.
So you sef get power to tell Satan sey make e get behind you.
If the whole issue of say power come, you wan get power.
You wan dey show sey na you dey dere.
Nobody dey dere now.
Na only God dey.
So di best ting na sey make you calm down.
Meh everybody humble himsef.
Meh everybody pele well, well.
If you calm down well, well, and you humble, God go give you di power wey you need.
And den we go to di third one money issue.
Everybody, na im want money dese days, everybody, na im dey do anyting for money.
Pikin dey kill mama, mama dey kill pikin.
All because e want money.
Everybody want money now.
But even Satan tempt Jesus on top money issue.
E show am all di glory.
E show am all di wealth.
E say dis one dey.
Better dey if you fit just bow, just bow to me.
Once you bow to me, so you go get all di money.
Wetin all of us dey bow to now?
We dey bow to different people.
We dey bow to people wey dey lie to us, we dey bow to traditionalists, we dey bow to different people, all, because we want money.
But Jesus dey tell us.
E say you no need to dey bow to people, bow to only God!
God go provide wetin you need.
Na wetin Jesus want make we do.
So we all need to learn sey nobody free from temptation.
And di fact na sey no be sin sey Devil tempt you o!
No be sin at all because Devil tempt Jesus sef.
Di only where wey sin dey na when you fall into di temptation.
So make una no worry.
Make una dey face temptation.
Una go face more even dis time well, well.
Because dis time na very, very serious time.
Na time to deprive yoursef of so many tings.
Time wey you go say dis ting, I no go do am again.
All di bad, bad tings wey I dey do before, I do dem no more.
Because Jesus come to con change us.
And anoder good ting for dis period na sey na season of mercy o.
God dey forgive all our sins.
No sin wey too big for am to forgive.
Na why e say (for wetin Paul talk for first Corinthians) sey where sin abound, grace abounds even all di more.
Where sin dey, grace, e plenty even all di more.
So no sin wey God no fit forgive.
Di major ting na sey make una tell am di sin.
Tell am your sin, make I tell am my sin.
If you hide your sin, noting wey Jesus no fit see.
So if you tell am your sin, e go forgive you.
E go remove everyting comot.
You know, if you look am well, well, one man, ehm Mahatma Ghandi talk am.
E say one day, e steal im papa bracelets.
As e steal di ting like dis, naim im papa dey look for di bracelet.
As im papa dey look for the ting, e no know wetin to tell im papa again.
E come one day, e con write am for inside paper.
Tell di papa sey na me steal your bracelet.
If na you be di papa so, and your pikin show you dat kind ting after you don suffer dey find di ting, wetin you go do am?
You go wan slap am.
But as e papa receive di paper read di ting, e just smile.
E just laugh to Mahatma Ghandi.
Mahatma Ghandi con shock say aha why papa dey laugh give me now?
Di papa con tear di paper, e con hug di boy, e con tell am sey I don forgive you, no worry.
From dat day eh, Mahatma Ghandi love im papa no be small because e no expect wetin di papa do.
Di same ting wey Jesus dey do for all of us.
All we need to do na make we tell am di sin.
E go tear everyting comot.
And e go love us di more, and we go even fit hug am well, well because na im be God.
E no be man.
Na man fit no forgive o.
Man fit no forgive.
Na why de say to err is human, to forgive is divine.
Man fit no forgive at all, but God dey forgive all di sin.
Wetin we need do na to tell am.
So dis season na di best time o di best time for all of us.
Make we come back to Jesus.
If we don sin before, make we no sin again.
Na why we dey di season of Lent.
And na di main reason wey we tell ourselves on dat Ash Wednesday sey remember dat you are dust, and to dust you shall return.
Na dust na im dem form us from.
Di basic difference between us, and dose tings wey fine artist dey do na sey God breathe life into us, but dose tings, nobody fit put life into dem.
But God so much love us.
After e form us finish, e bring life into us.
And we dey go back to dat same dust.
So na so e be today o.
Na so e be today.
Make all of us dey do well.
Make we journey through dis season well, well and we go see sey di mercy of God go dey upon us.
And im light go remove every darkness wey dey our body because all of us get one form of darkness, or di oda.
So I tank una o as una come so because if una no come, wetin we go do?

So as una come so, and as we dey do dis Eucharistic sacrifice, we pray make God accept our sacrifice o.
We pray meh God have mercy on us, make e forgive us, and make e remove all our sins trough Christ, our Lord, amen.

E go better.
Yes!
Okay if you wan make di gote, ehn after buying dose ingredient for your market, as you come back, come reach your home, ehn di first ting wey I go do, na di leaves wey I go put for water, den put salt.
Why should I put salt?
I dey put salt make e kill di germs wey don catch dis leaves because, on fire, I no go leave am tay o.
Na just about five minute.
So as I put am for water wit some salt (because vinegar, I no go fit get everytime), den, I go carry my bones, biscuit bone (dat is di one dat we normally use because e go make am sweet) put am for fire, put onions, and den tomatoes.
If I want, sometime, I dey make am witout tomatoes.
As e dey boil dere, I go come sit down cut my garden eggs, yalo, tiny ones to give it dat bitter taste.
As I, as I cut am, I go con add am on top of di bones as im dey boil for fire.
Den, I go come now cut my leaves.
As I dey cut am (you know some of dem have to stay a bit longer for di fire while some, na five minutes), I don bring am down.
Now eh di yakuwa, I go put am for say ten minutes.
So as di fi-... fi, bone don dey do, I go con add di yakuwa.
I don add my garden egg be dat bah?
Den, e dey boil, boil.
I don't like dat of ehn groundnut, adding groundnuts, but some people dey add am, or beans.
But my own, na so plain I dey take without groundnut.
Den, I go con cut di leaves, everyting, keep for side, carry my acha.
Di acha, na small I go fetch.
No be plenty.
Just like ehn tin ehen for four people.
Just dis small tin, I go fetch am.
Because e get stones, I have to wash it well using calabash.
Na calabash we dey use.
Put water two of dem, be shaking it clean, pour until wai twice, or three times like dis.
You go see di stones o, de go con go down.
Na only di acha go go di oder ehn dish.
Den you pour it, do it again about two three time.
Make you make sure sey all di sand don comot.
If you finish dat one, den you pour it.
Den you go dey stir.
You never add leaves o.
You go dey stir.
When it becomes thicken, den, you now carry di spinach, and di oder leaves wey you don cut before keep for side add.
And den, you stir, cover, leave it for say five minute like dis.
E go don do.
Make e no overtay because if e tay too much, even di leaves, e go change colour ehen, and maybe di nutritional value go destroy.
So you have to leave it like dat.
Bring it down.
It is now ready.
You fit eat am.
And dis gote o, we like it very much because it is very nutritional.
All di tings, ingredient wey you dey add, vitamins, minerals, oder tings dey.
So na im we dey make.
Once of our lunch, we dey take am.
Bones, di meat is proteinaceous.
Di acha too get protein abi?
Eh in di leaves, minerals, vitamins, oder tings dey.
So I don't, we no, I no dey add oil o.
No oil.
Is plain.
No add oil.
Most people don't like it wit oil.
Dat is how we take it.
Ehn so na so we dey cook am.
Den you take it.
If you finish eating, if you want to push it down, you fit take kunu, or gruel, di local kunu dat we take.
Den you push it down wit it.
And dis one, dis eh gote bah, is very good not only for ah medicinal pur-... diabetes.
People dat have diabetes, you know you no go fit take rice.
You no go fit ti-... take ehn maize, but acha is good.
So it is recommended for dem.
And when you sick, and you just dey recover, it is anoder recommended food for convalescence.
Na him we dey give people because if you no get appetite, e dey do.
Even small children, it's very good for every...
Di, dis word, gote ma, is di best for pregnant women because e dey add blood.
Di leaves dey add blood.
Even if you go for dis dem ehn normal maternity of a ting, dem dey tell us make we take plenty of leaves so dat our dis ting, our blood go come.
So is not only for di rich people as even if you are as poor as anyting, you fit make dis gote.
Very small money, very small money.
If you have two hundred naira, or five hundred naira you can make gote for di househood.
Buy dis kashi o-... hundred naira, two, two hundred, di garden egg fifty naira, hip-... spinach fifty naira, di oder leaves.
Dat is all.
And di acha small.
Dat is all.
So is very affordable.
You fit afford am.
E no dey expensive.
So everybody can make dis, and have a good meal, balanced diet wey at least your pocket no go suffer.
Hello my people!
Na me Chibozor Chilaka.
Na Jettan we dey so o.
But I no get much ting to say, but I go lead us go dis way sey life no dey easy o.
Una suppose know wetin dey happen now for dis country.
So many tings are happen, but we go still tank God for life.
No matter how hard life dey, but meh we remember sey God dey.
Because when we get God by our side, everyting go dey move even dough if you try sey you wan serve God, temptation go still dey come your way as a young man wey you be, or a young girl wey you be.
But wetin you go still know sey no matter how you try do am, problem go still come your way.
But dat one no mean sey una go give up o.
And even, even dough you dey try to serve God as a young man, or young girl wey you be, people go still dey tell you sey wetin you dey do?
You sure of wetin you dey do?
But moh leave dat one for now.
Moh still talk about wetin dey happen.
Anyting wey dey happen now for dis life bah, meh first put, you must put God first inside.
And, if you no put God insi-... inside wallahi, you dey waste your time.
So anyting wey you dey try do, meh, meh, moh try as a youth dey build up tings.
You know moh try dey build our, build life up.
Try dey do tings wey we suppose do so, and moh remember sey even for ehn Bible, for Proverb, e tell you sey meh try remember your creator when you dey young.
Cause if you no serve God now, you no know when next you go serve am.
Abi na when you don old?
Because even dough, if you remember for Bible well Cain, and Abel, Cain, you suppose know how Cain, and Abel own take end.
Cause Cain, im, im be farmer, im give God wetin no good while Abel im give God wetin good.
So if Cain, and Abel fit know wetin de suppose give God, (one give God wetin good, and one no give God wetin good), so now we wey con be youth, na when we old now we wan con serve God.
But dat one no mean, dat one no mean sey we no go live our life as a youth, but if we dey live our life as a youth, moh we still dey remember sey God dey.
Im dey take charge of everyting wey we dey do.
And anyting wey we dey do now, for future, we go still pay for am.
Any kind ting wey we eat now, anyting wey we drink now wey dey enter our body, for future we go fit still pay for am.
Wheder we dey drink, we dey smoke, we go still pay for am for future.
So anyting wey we dey do now for youth, moh remember sey life still dey front.
You no know wetin dey happen for front.
And to cut long matter short, moh still talk about, moh still talk about Nigeria problem.
So many ting don dey happen now because our government, in true, true, no dey really do wetin dey suppose do for us.
We all know sey problem dey up, right, left, and centre.
We talk of Boko Haram, we dey talk of IPO, we talk of Oduduwa.
So many tings dey on ground now wey even our government no wan come out con tell us di truth.
E don tay wey de tell us sey we be leaders of tomorrow.
But for when we wan become leader of tomorrow?
Na when we don old.
Now if we look very well, we no get any youth today wey dey comot say im wan con contest for anyting.
Highest, you go see us for social media.
We dey always press one phone, we dey do selfie, we dey do every kind of ting.
Yes dat one good for we dat, wey be youth.
Tah I no talk sey social media dey bad o.
E good for we.
But, make we s-... try our best, try build up oursef to become youth because if (like me) dey talk never comot say I wan con-... contest for gover-... governor now, una go tell me sey I be young man.
Sey I never reach di age.
If una no vote for me, who else una wan vote for?
Di same leader wey dey give us di, di same recycle ting wey dey happen.
De go bring anoder man today.
Dat man, if e no rule, im go bring im own pikin.
Im own pikin go bring im own pikin.
Me and you go still dey collect di same ting wey we dey collect.
De no dey ever im-... improve our life in any way.
So make we as a youth try to build up oursef.
Moh we try believe in oursef, and moh we try support each oder.
Moh no look down on anybody wey decide tomorrow sey e wan contest for di betterment of dis country.
And mtschew anoder ting be sey we as a youth, we need to dey build oursef.
School dey only wey we dey go no fit make us become better people because dis school na garbage in, garbage out.
Dis country for long, how many years since when we, de born us up till now?
Noting dey move.
Rader, tings dey dey bad to bad.
Even our parent go tell us sey when de dey much younger, tings (during deir own time) dey better o.
Now (we don reach now), our own tings still no dey better.
Na better ting?
No be better ting na, be dis now.
If you go oder countries, de dey increase.
De dey do research every time.
Tings dey always increase for dem day by day.
De always try to do tings wey go better for dem tomorrow.
Even some people, deir countries, de dey mostly use schools, people wey go school.
Dough maybe one department fit decide to do research.
Dat research wey dat student do, na im go help di country.
Before you know, de don increase.
Before you know, oder people go come around, come, con buy tings for di, di same school o.
Na dat same school na im dey bring about development.
But for here for Nigeria, noting like dat dey happen o.
If me, and you do research, na computer we go go, or we go go cyber cafe, or we go go our school lab go collect work wey person don do.
Dey do di same old ting wey person don do.
We go still dey do di same ting.
So tell me how we wan take grow today.
We no go fit grow if dis ting continue like dis.
So we must hold our leaders accountable for everyting wey de dey do for us.
Because if we no hold dem, dis country no go move forward.
And di problem wit we, sey we, we dey fear.
If one man comot today say e wan re-... do, e wan cause revolution, dis one go run comot say im hand no dey.
If you go for oder country, wheder developed countries, de no get two head wey we get o, only wetin help dem to develop demsef.
De leave religious aside, leave (ehn wetin de call am) ethnicity aside.
De just embrace one ting which is unity.
And dat unity na bring about dat development for dat country.
My name na Joy, Joy Jatto.
I dey work for dis school wey we dey so.

Even if I go Lagos, heat no dey gree me stay because I don dey use to dis town.
Dis our weather, na beautiful weather.
And we no dey like to dey leave am anyhow like dat because here na home.
E just dey like sey we dey America.
E no...
De say if Jos man go America, e no go suffer again because di cold wey dey here sef be like sey...
I never go America sha o, but di cold, e be like di one wey dem dey describe for America.
So if person leave Jos go America now, e fit stay because you don dey use to di weather.
Hm for hair, you know sey we get plenty hairstyle wey we dey like to dey plait for dis Jos.
We get beriberi style.
De plait am front, and back.
Dem go pack am like dis, e go fine, e dey very cheap.
You go see our girls dey make am.
No dey too wear weavon for here.
Na plaiting.
People dey wear weavon, but no-... not much o.
Na plaiting we dey plait for here.
Because to plait, for here, e no cost at all.
And Jos people sabi to make hair.
Before una go sef, I fit show una where una go fit go make una hair.
Una go like am.
E dey very cheap, very affordable, and e go last you.
We fit make hair now, carry am for one month.
You still see am.
E go still dey new.
Because dem go plait am well.
But Jos, to make hair (just because di hair sef, na im be di main business for women here), you no go fit just call your hairdresser sey you want go make hair.
You go book her because people dey plenty for dere.
E get plenty, plenty girls wey dey make hair for here, but you, you go book first because di queue dey plenty most of di time.
See why me, I like Jos?
Because life for dis place na jeje.
No wahala, no rushing like all dese Lagos, no heat, nothing.
Even as rain dey fall sef, you go just see sey our weather sweet.
You no get any problem.
Wo-... reach, eh rashes no go dey comot for your body because heat no dey.
Na better weather dey here.
No go fit compare am with Lagos because heat too much for dat side!
You go see rashes, you go see people skin dey spoil, but for here, di weather dey sweet us.
We no dey worry for rashes, or anyting.
As di weather dey sef, we no too dey do any makeup.
And if you say you go do your makeup, e no go spoil.
You know sey if heat too much, e dey spoil makeup, but for here, people wey dey do makeup, e go last dem because di weather dey cold.
E dey good, and e no dey affect makeup.
So me, I like dis my Jos very well.
Plateau State na home of peace, and tourism, a beautiful place to be.
And I sure sey before una go go, if una go back house now sef, una go dey feel am sey ah una don leave better place now.
Because di weather, I know sey una dey catch cold, but by now una don dey use to am.
Because na good weather dey here.
Dere is no any wahala about it.
Na very peaceful people, very accommodating.
If you talk, dem go listen to you, if you want anyting, if you lost your way sef, you go see plenty people wey go guide you.
Nobody want collect your money.
Nobody!
We no dey do picking pocket for Jos o.
E dey hard.
No dey do dat one for here at all.
De no dey snatch people bag for Jos like dat.
Hm'M!
Di people dey very okay wit di little wey dem get.
Na very peaceful people, and very accommodating.
We no get wahala like dat.
Di ting wey I go tell una about dis Jos.
Tank you very much!
Most people dey talk about why men dey watch football.
In di first place, if you see man dey watch football, most times...
Typically, anyway some women dey watch ball.
But you go see maybe na one out of ten, or two out of ten.
Mostly, football fans na men.
I sidown tink am one day.
Any house wey you go, if you see di men wey dey di house, if de wan show ball, de go say ah ball dey.
De wan watch match, de wan watch match.
Di women go say no no de wan, na Zee World de wan watch, or de wan watch Big Broder, or someting.
De go come begin drag remote.
You know or you go see one person go say ah no, na ball we must watch.
Di oder ones go go sit down one side dey complain.
Sey dis people, wetin de dey even see for dis ball?
De dey pay una?
You sabi di people wey dey play?
Ehn ball wey no concern you, you go sit down, you wan kill yoursef.
I sidown tink am.
Wetin make men like to dey watch ball?
So I sit down, come bring out three tings wey I see wey make men like to dey watch ball wey dey different from women.
No be sey I say anybody dey right, or e dey wrong o.
But e get differences wey dey between men, and women, wey make men like ball, wey women no too send am.
And number one ting be sey every man right from when you born male pikin (wey be sey im na small pikin), de get dat hunger for competition pass women.
Na deir nature be dat.
Once you born male pikin, dat desire for competition dey inside im mind.
E wan test imsef against im mate make im see sey na im comot as di best.
Dat desire for competition dey inside us.
And we dey carry am grow.
Once you see man don grow up, even if e imsef no fit take part for competition, e go wan watch make e say okay na dis people I dey support.
And di day wey de win, e go be like sey na im play ball win.
Dat'S why you dey see us.
We dey talk ball.
We go say ah we win dis people, we win dose people.
You be Chelsea, you no be Chelsea, you no dey dere.
You never near deir stadium before, but you go say na we, na we.
Na because we don identify wit dem.
Why?
Because of dat nature of competition wey dey inside men.
Secondly, every male child get dat desire make e see somebody wey be im hero.
Men get desire for hero.
De get dat need to, for somebody wey de dey look up to, wey de wan be like right from small.
Dat is why men, if you see dem dey watch (even when de dey small), de like cartoon like Ben Ten, de like tings like Superman, de like Batman, de like Spiderman.
Why?
Because dis na people wey dey do tings against all odd, and de go comot as Champion.
Di ting get wetin e dey pull for inside man soul, and na wetin make us like to dey watch ball be dat.
Because football dey give us hero wey we dey look everyday.
People like Cristiano.
We go see people like Messi, you go see people like Neymar, we dey see boys like eh wheder na Juan Mata, or Lukaku.
We dey see dem.
And na people wey be sey even if we no sabi ball, de dey represent for us.
We go come make dem our hero.
And di third reason, every man wan be champion for someting.
Even if no be you carry ball enter field go play, you wan carry dat mentality sey we do someting.
And we win, we achieve no matter di circumstance wey we see oursef.
All di odds wey come against us, we don conquer dem.
We don emerge as Champion.
And na wetin every man like be dat.
So na wetin make men like to dey watch ball pass women.
Because women no be sey de no like dis tings.
But mtschew de no too send am.
Dose kind tings no dey for woman psychology di way e dey for man own.
So dat's why women prefer to watch tings wey dey calm, wey get mild eh story.
You know someting wey be sey na gist?
Dat'S why de go watch Zee World because na story,
Dat'S why de dey watch Telemundo.
Why?
Because na story.
No be tings wey be sey everyti-...
Infact, if you see most women, no be all women like action movie.
De like someting wey dey calm wey be sey na story wey de dey tell, wey get sweet ending, happy ending.
Na wetin women like dey watch be dat.
But men mind dey different.
So if we fit get dis understanding between oursef, maybe women go stop to dey harass say why men dey watch football?
Why be sey de go sit down burn ninety minutes talk sey you wan watch twenty two boys just dey dey kick ball up, and down?
De no understand.
If you sit down tink am, you go fit get dat level of where man mind dey.
You go come leave am say okay I know wetin you dey feel, I know how you dey tink.
Sit down, watch your ball.
We no send you.
Go do your own.
Later, we go do our own.
Tank you very much!
Ehen di method wey e take cook egusi, na two.
Step one, method one, na im be dis.
You go f-... you go don grind your pe-...
Your pepper wey don already grind, keep!
You understand?
Di pepper now, e dey one side.
Your fish, everyting, you go wash am keep like dat.
And your maggi (you go don already crumble di maggi), drop am!
Den you go (on your gas) put am for fire, put your pot for fire.
If you put your pot for fire, eh you add up red oil.
If you add red oil, you go allow am, mtschew go allow am hot small.
If e don hot small like dat, you just put your onion.
After you put your onion, you pour your pepper.
If you pour your pepper, you stir.
After you stir, you go con pour water, put your maggi, put your fish, put everything.
Put your okporoko dem.
Put am!
After you put am, you cover am make e boil small.
If e boil, you go con put your egusi.
Di egusi you don already grind keep, you go con put am.
But if e get, if you wan make e do seed, seed, you go like press am.
Press di egusi so dat oil go comot!
If oil comot now, you go start dey put am for di soup like sey you dey make crumbles inside di soup like dat.
If you don put am inside di soup like dat, you cover am for like ten to fifteen minute.
After e don, you go con put your ugwu, or waterleaf.
Any leaf wey you just get, you just put am on top.
Leave am for like one minute or so.
Di egusi soup, e don ready.
Dat's step one.
Dat one na step one, method one.
Anoder method wey you dey carry cook egusi soup, your egusi, e go.
Di grounded egusi, you go make am, turn am to paste.
You go put water.
Small water o!
Dat kind small water like dat, you go put am like dat.
Like you go stir am, stir am, stir am.
Keep am for one side!
You go put oil for pot.
Instead of putting pepper direct like di oder method, dis time around now, na di egusi you pour direct for dat oil wey don hot.
Now, as dat oil don hot, now wey you don pour your egusi, you go just dey stir am.
You go dey stir am till di ting burn.
You see sey di ting don fry well, well.
E don dey even burn sef.
You go con pour water.
You pour water inside, you put your pepper.
Now, you go con, you pour your ingredient, your pepper, your fish, your, your stock, your okporoko.
If you like, you fit put bitter leaf.
After you put am, you don put your maggi, you cover am if e boil.
Sey e don boil, den you put your leaf.
When you put your leaf, sey e don do, bring am down!
Your egusi, e don ready.
Den ogbonno.
Ogbonno soup.
Ogbonno soup dey very, very easy to cook you understand.
Ogbonno sef, like some people, some go dey fry deir pepper before de do di ogbonno.
But di method wey everybody dey use sha, for dis side, for dis our area, you put water for fire.
After you put your water for fire, you put your pepper, your maggi, your stockfish, your crayfish, your ponmo, everything.
Eh you know your orisirisi, you go don put am.
After you put am, you put your maggi, den cover am.
Allow am make e boil.
Den your egusi, your grounded ogbonno, sorry your grounded ogbonno, you mix am wit oil.
You go mix am to like paste.
Withdraw oil, den you put am inside dat, di water.
E go boil, go scatter for inside di water.
When e boil, you see sey...
Because when e boil now, e start dey draw, everyting go just normalise.
Den, your ugwu, or your...
Yes, your ugwu wey e dey washed already, you go con put am.
Just after one minute, you bring am down.
Your ogbonno, e don ready.
Dat is all.
My name na Jacob from Kaduna.
When I grow up wit my grandfader, na im dey take care of me.
My parents dey for Lagos.
Na dere I dey stay.
De carry me come Kagoro.
And I was dere, grow up.
Im put me for secondary school, im put me for primary school.
All di schools.
And I was very happy with im.
Wey, everyting wey I dey do na im dey do am for me.
And when e, when I grow up, when I about to marry, e was, e pronounce a wife for me, which I don't know.
And di time reach wey be sey (God don say dis di time wey my grandfader talk am) di wife came.
And di way I marry dat time, no be di so de, de dey do nowadays.
Now, na plenty, plenty money de dey give.
Dat time, me, na two thousand naira I give as bride price.
Even de collect am say de go, were very happy.
But now, if you no bring goat, twenty bags of eh cement, eh twenty bags of eh salt, rice, everyting!
Wit donkey sef de say de may bring!

See how di world be!
Na so we go carry everyting go?
How di gene-... generation go be?
Maybe de go say meh de build house for dem parents.
We pray dat God will help us in dis generation, dat tings will come better.
And nowadays, even women now, maybe no be men dey go look for dem.
Na women de go look for wom-... mow-... man now.
De wan marry by force.
I pray dat God will help us, for us to search oursef to see better ting in life, for God to continue to be wit us, and guide us.
And anoder ting again, women don't compose deirsef, de didn't compose deirsef.
De don't compose deirsef at all.
If de compose deirsef, dress fine, look very fine, na dere men...
When we go come back, and see dem, and say de wan marry dem.
But we have different tradition.
Di South have deir own tradition, di North have deir own tradition, di Middle Belt has deir own tradition.
Some, dey, dey, dey do am small, small.
Some dey do am wit plenty money.
So we don't know how we go bring tings togeder.
Maybe sey God go help us to reverse all dese tings dat we will come togeder as one family, as Nigerians, to help one anoder to do tings di way God will help us dat we will be eh very happy wit it.
Na so we see am o.
But ah di question wey I wan ask be sey how will Nigeria come togeder?
Wey be sey we go do, put dis bride price togeder dat we become one, dat we...
Anoder place, parent will not suffer am, anoder place, go suffer am.
Some many places, if you no carry plenty tings come, de no go give you.
De go say make you build house for dem.
Some, some pla-... place again, de go say just carry go!
De don give you.
So, how can we bring dis ting togeder, and help oursef in life?
Oh!
We tank God dat God in infinite mercy go help us, go help us well, well.
E see sey dese tings go become better ting in life, and change us in Nigeria.
And we pray dat God will hel-... give us better people wey go hear us.
And all dese tings, de will hear dem for dem to come togeder, and see sey we do better ting for Nigeria.
Tank God!
And many places wey we dey see now, our hospital, many people are sick.
Sometimes, no medicine.
De go dey dere o.
Wahala.
Wahala.
Nobody go, fit go hospital again because no money.
Money be sey some fit eat, some no fit eat.
Some fit pay hospital bill, some no fit pay hospital bill.
How can we resolve dis in dis country?
We pray our God will help us, pray dat God will help us.
And our leaders, meh de kuku see sey de help di poor one to do tings dat will help us in life.
Our doctors again, de dey go strike.
People dey die.
So where are we heading oursef to?
How are we heading oursef to?
Doctors too have mercy upon us.
And di government too, de should see sey de pay di doctors.
Meh de come, make de help di poor, make de reduce medicine money for us.
We dat can not pay plenty money, abeg meh de help us, meh de help us o, meh de help us.
And we will go to school again.
School, if you no get money, you no go get better school.
Primary, if you no get better money, even five hundred naira, some people no fit pay.
Some parent no fit pay five hundred naira talk less of two hundred naira!
We pray God will help us because everything wey we say, we dey pray for, na God we dey look for.
And when God touch deir, deir heart, de go look unto di poor.
We pray God will help us.
Even di way we eat, food money money, money, you can not even buy a mudu of rice.
De go tell you sey mudu of rice na six hundred naira.
Which work man go go do get six hundred naira go buy mudu of rice?
You no talk of di ting wey you go put inside.
You go buy maggi o, buy tattasai o, buy tomato o.
Onion, how much you go pay?
How much you go get?
You get plenty children, twelve children, six children, seven children, your mudu of rice, one no go fit do dem.
And if you work sef, no payment.
Plenty, plenty people wey don resign, de die.
No payment.
Salary, de no pay.
Everywhere, etin-... everyting hook.
So, what do de want us to do?
And many tings wen de bin come be sey rituals don enter country.
Kidnapping everywhere because of money.
It is a government dey pay all dese tings X, for, for di staff, give dem everyting.
At least, everyting for better.
De catch person dere, catch persons dere, shoot everybody, kill everybody.
Toh, where are we going, where are we going, where are we going?
Soldier man wey de say de dey, na dem dey guide us, de dey kill dem.
Toh, we no love one anoder.
Everytime wahala, wahala, wahala!
Where una wan us run to?
Make una leave Nigeria for una?
Abi dose wey dey carry dis ting do, make we leave Nigeria for una?
If we leave Nigeria for una, how many people will stay?
Eyinaya Family, will you be able to stay in Nigeria?
You alone?
E can not be possible.
God, help us dat even our soldiers will help us.
See rain!
Drain everywhere!
Water dey carry people load, water dey kill people.
No better road, no better drainage.
Everyting, wahala.
God, help us, God, help us!
Let our X, leaders hear us o!
Make de hear God voice o, and do di, dat ting wey dey carry dem dere.
De warn dem make de do better ting.
No be, no be sey make, make de chop alone, leave di poor, and make de die.
If di poor die, who de go govern?
Nobody!
We pray dat God will help dem to see dis tings, and help us.
Ehn my name na John Nkemjika Nwobo.
I come from Imo State.
Well my people, as in things no easy now o.
Because ehn I remember, dat Jonathan time o, everybody just dey flex, but dis Buhari regime, things no easy at all.
I wanna, I just dey wonder wetin go happen within as in di citizen in di next ten years.
As things dey go now, things no funny at all.
Ehm like if you think dat time of Jonathan, contract dey come out, people dey work.
Well ehm, dem dey give out tin, people dey travel.
To travel is very easy, but now, tins just dey like sey nothing dey happen.
I wonder wetin dey happen with Nigeria for now.
Well my broder, I really believe sey di situation of dis country now, na something eh all of us need to gather together, talk about am.
All of us need to gather together, talk about am, know how we go take solve our problem.
Because, we no fit leave, let Americans come solve our problem.
We need to do am within ourselves.
When, when you talk about ehm di student now, for you to, ehn for you to get admission now, e no easy.
You need to struggle.
You go write...
You go see people wey no write, no even write exam, you go see dem just enter, but you wey rest, struggle write post UME and every oder thing, you need to stay back and, and den you need to say okay de go like.
You have to struggle before if you don't have anybody.
Na so di country just be now.
So for you to get anything for Nigeria now na just connection.
Even di oder day sef, I get, I go ehn party with my madam.
As we enter hall, naim, di woman come dey ask me who I follow come?
I tell am sey na one madam before she give me plate of rice!
Imagine!
To even get plate of rice for Nigeria now, na connection.
Uhm!
Di thing no easy at all but...
Well bro, wetin me I just dey really think of ehn di country now na make we just find way (as in know how), things we go take solve our problem for now.
Because if we dey wait for our government, dem no go help us.
And also my fellow youths like me also...
And I dey also advise dem when it comes to...
Like our guys wey dey do yahoo, and oder stuff like dat, dose stuff no dey pay at all.
Dose things no dey pay.
I notice some guys now, de will tell you sey dis man wey dey ride dis car no get two heads.
Meself wan be like am.
But all dose things no dey pay.
We need to like just know wetin we fit work on our own.
Like if you go China now, you go see young boys now, all dese phone wey dey use, na dem dey do am, bring send for us, we dey buy.
Because all dose cars wey we dey use, na young boys like us dey design am.
But for Nigeria here, wetin we dey always take na yahoo, and, or oil bunkering, and di rest.
Ehn but I know sure sey dose, dose ones no pay at all.
So ehn na just for us to work hard, den think further, and know how we fit take solve our problem.
Like as I dey now, I remember o when I work with one Indian man.
I, I try save small money, come buy one small motor, come use am dey do taxi.
Dat was ahm four back, four years back, but one of my guy come dey like guy, you no suppose dey do dis kind thing!
But I con like advise di guy say na just with time, and perseverance, and things go surely dey okay.
Na through dat taxi I come meet...
As me and you dey talk now, through dat taxi I meet di HR manager of Total, di Mr Didebey from France.
And since I meet dat man, things don somehow change for my life.
Di man don advise me about education, di man don talk to me.
Tell me sey imself pass through wetin me I dey pass now.
But im later excel in life.
But make I just continue to do my own things di way wey I believe am, and God go really see me through.
Even as I, me, and you dey talk now, di man don go back France.
But di man still...
Yet everyday me, and am dey chat on WhatsApp.
E dey call me.
E still dey like push me to people wey go fit like assist me ehn maybe when I don graduate so dat I fit get ehn good job to change my life.
So na so just life be.
Life no really easy.
And I no believe sey if your parent born you, you no get anything, you go remain like dat.
E depend how, how you struggle, and how you wan really help yourself.
Well, when you, when people talk sey na people like Dangote, Odetola, and di rest, sey na because, sey na, I no believe.
Because if you read di history of Dangote, and all dose rich men today, di way wey dey take start, you self, you go wonder whether...
As in you go just imagine sey no be deir parents lay di foundation for dem.
Na just de, something wey de really want do, and how dey want take work out things for deir life to make a better life for dem.
So I really believe sey when you believe in yourself, you really make am in life.
You no need to depend on anybody.
You no need to, you no need like...
Since maybe because your parents no born you, your parents no get money, na im make you poor.
Meh, meh you no think like dat.
Na all dose negative thinking go really push you back.
So ehn as for my parents, I thank dem sey de bring me come dis world, and I don see how things be, and ehn all, everything wey I need to do now, na to work hard to make sure sey my junior ones, or my future children no go pass through wetin me, I pass through.
My name na Adeniyi Moruf Mustapha.
Eh my, I, I, my state na Oyo State.
Aldough na Lagos dem born me, and everyting about me, na Lagos I do am, I, I go to eh CMS primary school wey dey Bariga.

Den e come carry me go Ibadan.

And na dere I come finish my secondary school.
But di ting wey I go remember, why...
Because I studied...
Ehm I read accounting for school.
But wetin I go remember wey make me read dis course, because di ting wey, wey really sweet my belle make I do for my life, na electrical engineer.
Because I remember dat time when I dey small, everyting wey concern eh electric, na im I dey put hand.
And I, I like di job well, well.
So e come get one day, e come call me.
When I dey...
E be like sey I dey SS one.
E come call me sey wetin be di job wey I wan do?
If I, if I want go school...
And me eh when, when...
Before im carry me go Ibadan, I dey CMS.
B-... ehen before im carry me go Ibadan, when I dey CMS, I...
After my eh JSS three wey I come, I want enter SS.
So I remember sey I no, I no resume.
Maybe I may...
Di ting wey I go fit, wey I go fit talk sey e cause am be sey I no resume SS one on time.
So by di time wey I go say make I go resume, di science class wey suppose put me for electrical, de don start.
So when I come stay dere for like eh almost, one month don nearly knock mtschew!
I just observe sey e be like sey I no grab wetin de dey do.
I just carry my chair go eh art eh, art class.
No.
Art class!
So after wey I don finish second term, naim my papa come call me.
And I know sey di ting wey t-... cause am too again be sey nobody wey go fit tell me sey, if you want do so, so, so ting o, no comot for.
So as I don go art class, e come ask sey wetin you want do sef?
I come say na electric.
E say eh you dey fool yourself!
Electrical?
And you dey art?
E say you don miss am, na, na im be sey you no go fit go.
Sey make I tink of eh anyting, anoda ting wey I go fit do, wey go relate to di class wey I dey now.
I come say na banking, and finance.
E say im no like banking, and finance.
Sey di tin go just tie me for one place.
I no go fit...
Sey na only bank, and eh dese people wey de do money, money tin, na dere I go dey mtschew.
So he now said...
In fact na my papa choose dis account for me.
Because im feel sey account, you fit work for anywhere.
So from dere, when I come finish for, eh for Tayyibaat, luckily, when I finish in two thousand and, nineteen ninety four, by nineteen ninety five, early eh in eh...
When e don reach (eh I tink) January nineteen ninety five, or ninety February, I enter Oko Poly.
Oko Poly na small school for Anambra State.
Eh Federal Polytechnic Oko, na dere I come do my ND.
Den I do my eh IT for one Federal, Federal ministry like dat.
Den after which I come go Yaba Tech, go do my HND.
And I...
Na di accounting wey a-... I read all through.
Den later, I go serve for Imo.
But e get one time wey I get fire accident.
So dat fire accident injury still dey my body when I go serve.
So and because I no wan stay for dat side, I come write letter give dem say see o, I get eh medical challenge o.
So sey meh dem return me back to...
Na so di tin come jell.
De come return me back to Lagos.
So I finish my, my eh service for Lagos.
Den my papa na somebody wey be sey e love book well, well.
Love book, wey be sey di, e know sey im do mistake for not, for not putting me for right place from beginning o.
But after dat time, im come dey follow me for my education.
Sey im wan, im want make sure sey dis one wey I dey do, di highest, di, di level wey person wey do dis course dey dey, you go reach am, and im no dey leave my neck.
So I come gain eh job for Lagos State.
But when I come reach Lagos State, di salary no good.
And if you want do dat kind course, na money.
And my papa mtschew, tings no dey im pocket like, as e dey when im, when we dey small.
So e b-... e feel say shebi you don dey work?
You, you, you fit, you fit sponsor yourself go (you know) where you want go.
So e come dey my neck since because I enter dis job for two thousand, and one.
So e come dey my neck.

So...
Eh una, good afternoon.
My name na Lekan.
And me, I dey work with Lasaco Assurance PLC.
And basically, wetin we dey do no be sey we just dey collect money from people.
And I know sey una don hear about insurance before.
And una go dey ask sey wetin dem dey do for insurance company?
We dey very simple.
You know sey as person dey live, danger dey everywhere.
Sey you sleep, wake up, you bath.
Sey you go out.
Na risk on its own.
And wetin we dey do for our own company be sey all dose risk wey man dey face (you dey find wetin you go chop on a daily basis), na dose risks we dey accommodate.
Na im we dey protect una sey if anyting happen, we go give una money.
See!
For insurance eh you fit...
Anything wey you place value, anyting wey be sey you love, anyting wey you treasure, we fit protect am.
Na wetin insurance dey do for people be dat.
We fit insure your car, we fit insure your life, we fit insure your house.
Even your children wey you love sef, we fit do insurance policy for dem.
And all dese tings get im own benefit.
No be sey person go just dey collect your money, and you go dey fear.
Nobody know wetin go happen tomorrow.
Person fit sleep make e no wake up tomorrow.
And you don plan for your mind sey you want send dat your lovely child go school.
Insurance fit guarantee sey dat child go go school even weda you dey around, you no dey around.
So insurance dey beautiful.
But as time dey go, we know sey we go reach one level for dis our country, and everybody go appreciate wetin insurance dey do for people.
To enjoy life, to sleep with your two eyes closed.
In fact no dey go k-...
Elders talk sey if you want sleep, make you open one eye, but we fit guarantee you sey with insurance eh, you fit sleep with all your eyes closed.
No shaking.
We get your back.
So na wetin insurance dey do for people be dat.
Tank you!
Sometimes una go dey wonder sey shey insurance dey for person wey get money, person wey no too get money, shey im fit buy insurance?
See di truth be sey insurance dey for everybody.
But because we dey fear sey na person wey don chop wella, wey im pocket full fit buy insurance, with five thousand naira, you fit buy insurance policy for your life.
You fit protect your house with less dan five thousand.
Insurance no be sey dem create am for person wey get money.
In fact, na people wey no too get money di ting dey benefit pass.
If you build house, and your house na maybe ten million naira, di money wey you go pay us to protect your house if fire burn am no reach three thousand naira.
So compare, make una compare di money wey you go pay with di danger wey go happen if dat house burn!
So wheda you get money, abi you no get money, any product wey you want buy, na you go tell us di protection wey you need, and we go give you advice.
We go tell you how much you go pay, wetin you fit protect, how you go go about am.
See, insurance dey beautiful, even for school, anywhere wey you dey, for church.
I know sey pastor go tell you sey make you carry your faith put am for God.
Sey God get your back.
Na true!
No be lie!
But God, as God don get your back, im don give you brain say make you take protect yourself too.
Na wetin insurance dey do be dat.
Make...
No be sey I dey tell you sey God no dey protect people.
No!
God dey protect people.
E get our back accepted, but yousef suppose do one, or two tings.
Make you add one to two.
Make everyting dey, take tanda sey if anyting happen, you sure sey money dey somewhere wey go keep you on your feet.
E no good when you go dey work, you dey find wetin you go chop, and someting happen, you no fit make money again.
If you no fit make money again with insurance, dat money wey you dey make while you still dey work go dey enter?
Insurance go ensure sey any money wey you dey make before, even now when something don happen (wheda na accident o, wheda na sickness o, abi death)...
I know sey you go talk.
All of us dey pray sey make we live long for life.
Na so!
But if e happen, insurance don guarantee sey if death eventually occur, sey if di ting happen, money dey wey dem go give your family say di loss wey una suffer, una husband, abi una wife don plan sey, na so, so, so thing e get in mind for una.
Dat ting wey you get in mind, insurance fit even make you achieve am wheda you dey around, abi you no dey around.
Una fit come, and you fit insure anyting.
You know in so far you love dat ting, you, you know sey dat ting eh dey very important.
Insurance na di answer wey you suppose get.
Insurance na di way out wey go protect everyting wey you place value on for dis life.
E fit be your life, e fit be your wife, e fit be your children.
E fit be deir education sey you want make dem go school, make dem study, make dem become lawyer, make dem become doctor, make dem become anyting for dis life.
Insurance go help you achieve dat one.
In fact, you dey work before, work no dey again, insurance still fit protect di salary wey you dey earn before, wey you dey collect from your employer.
So e no mata wheda...
Oh I no get work again, I no fit dey pay.
In fact, after you don retire, when you don tell your employer sey di one wey I don do with una don do, sey now I want rest and enjoy my money, insurance still fit protect dat money as well.
Wey be sey even if you finish di money wey dem give you, we go dey pay you dey go so far you don come tell us sey you want protect dat money wey you collect.
Dat one, we dey call am annuity.
So you go see sey if you look insurance very well, e get advantage.
No be sey person go collect your money.
In fact e dey beautiful sotay once you enta business with us, you go enjoy am.
Na because of una de establish us.
Na una we come serve.
And di money wey una go pay, no be sey di ting much.
So if you don tell us wetin you want protect, our own na to just give you advice sey okay o, as you don tell us sey na dis one you want protect, we go tell you na shikini money you go pay.
If you combine, if you compare how much you go pay, and wetin you want protect, you go see sey na shikini money.
You s-... hustle, you struggle buy car one million naira.
You pay fifty thousand naira to protect dat car.
If dem steal am, you go get anoda one, if fire burn am, you go get anoda one.
If you jam person, and person, or person jam you, we go repair am for you ni.
So you too look am!
Fifty thousand to one million, you go tink sey na shikini money.
Even for your life o, for your property o, anyting, di money wey we go give you sey we take compensate you, sey you get contract with us, sey we want protect you, if you compare am to di money wey you, you go pay us, na just shikini money.
You no go even feel am for your pocket.
E no even reach money wey you go sp-... spend jolloficate from January to December.
So with dis money wey you dey spend anyhow, you fit use am protect yourself, protect your children, protect your family, and protect people around you.
Na wetin insurance come do for people be dat.
Tank you!
Na here we dey do shawarma, and dis place na Lucky Special Shawarma wey we dey do here.
Toh na me dey do am.
My name na Fidelis Isaac.
As shawarma dey like dis, it has eh...
We have grade by grade.
E dey grade by grade.
So we have di one of five hundred naira.
And e dey di one wey e be seven hundred.
Di oder one na one thousand naira.
Dat, all of dem na big shawarma.
We get di one wey be chicken shawarma.
And as de dey like dis now, di one of ehm five hundred, na one sausage wey we dey put am.
Di one of seven hundred, two sausage, na im we dey put am.
But di one of one thousand, na two sausage, and e go be jumbo size.
So as we dey do am here, na so market dey grow because di price is dis eh constant you know.
Now di ingredients now, na salad wey we dey use.
Salad na cabbage.
We go slice am, put carrot, put eh sweet corn, green beans, and all dis things.
And ehn you go put beef meat.
Beef meat na cow meat.
You go put eh chicken.
Chicken na fowl you know.
So dis one na pepper wey we dey put am also.
And dis is Lebanese bread, Chinese bread.
Naim, we dey use put all dese ingredients come fold, and wrap am.
Dis is my toaster.
So dis are di things dat make shawarma.
And it has to do wit you know time, and discipline for someone to sell shawarma.
So it's a, it's a thing of commitment.
Na im we dey do am here.
So as work no dey for Nigeria now, we just say meh we dey do shawarma.
At least to create jobs chance meh person dey work.
Eh here na Ajegunle.
So ehm people dey try sha.
Na im make di price come small like dis five hundred naira so dat people go buy.
And by His, by di grace of God, de are buying, de are buying, de are trying.
Anybody wey want pass, wey wan buy, im go come.
Na im make me stay here dey sell am.
So na so e be.
Like me, here wey I dey, dis place now o, dis side of Ajegunle, na one o'clock wey I dey open for afternoon, con close eleven.
So as dat time now, I believe sey people wey wan return work go branch my spot, my shawarma spot, con buy.
Uhm dat is it.
Una good morning o!
I say make I greet una dis morning.
I be Awa Olowookere, Assistant Co-commander di Unit Commander Isolo for Federal Road Safety Corp.
Road safety na dose people wey dey for road, wey una dey see for road, wey una dey vex if una see dem dey stop una.
But now, no be di only ting wey we dey dey do.
Our work for road safety na to teach people wey dey use road.
And na everybody dey use road.
So we see sey we dey go from office, to churches, to mosque.
We dey go talk to people about road safety.
We dey tell people all di things wey dem suppose do, wey dem need to do to make sure gbe sey deir motor e ready for road.
Because no be every motor person suppose carry to enter road.
You go don leave motor for some time, di motor dey dere, you park am, you travel.
When you come back, you just come, you wash am, you on your engine, you move.
When you reach so-... road now, di motor go stop, you go begin complain.
Na wetin we dey talk be dat.
So before you move your motor for morning, you suppose check.
Some tings dey wey you suppose look.
Suppose check di radiator, check di level wey your water reach.
You go check your oil.
Make you look wheder dat motor even due, if e don due for service, or wheder di oil still (e get ah wetin we dey call viscosity), wheder di, di, di oil still soft wey you go feel dey carry you.
Because if you no look all dese things...
Check your tyre.
Una know one thing?
Di tyre na dat thing wey only im dey touch di road.
As you dey inside dat motor, na tyre dey control di motor wey dey make am move.
Because you know, motor na iron.
If you leave only di iron, e no go move.
So we dey tell una sey you need to check your tyre.
Before you buy tyre, look di date of manufacture.
You no go see expiry day for tyre o.
Na date of manufacture, di day wey dem make dat tyre.
So when you look di day, you wit-...
Di first two number wey dey for dat tyre...
Na four number you go see, but di first two number na di week wey dem produce dat tyre.
Den di last two number go tell you about di year.
So if you see tyre wey dem make, wey you, wey dem write one one fourteen, dat means sey na in di eleventh week of twenty fourteen na im dat tyre, dem make dat tyre.
So you go count four years.
Dat go tell you when dat tyre go expire.
So you need to dey check your tyre.
No just take eye look tyre say ah di teeth still sharp, dis tyre clean well, well, na good tyre.
No!
Check your tyre!
And when you go, if you wan eh check your tyre, look di body of your door.
If you open your door, you go see di side of di door.
E get one iron dere wey dem dey call metal.
You go see di tyre pressure wey each of your tyre suppose carry.
And na dat limit you suppose inf-... put air for inside, pump your tyre.
So if you pump your tyre within, with limit wey dey for dat instruction, e go help you.
So you no go get case of sey your tyre over-... you overinflate your tyre, sey air too plenty inside, or e too low.
Because if air too much for tyre, e get...
Ah you know as blow, blow dey be now.
If you blow am, blow am, blow am, if you just carry sharp object, sharp thing touch dat blow, blow, wetin go happen?
E go burst.
Naim we go dey shout ah tyre don burst o, tyre don...
Na something make dat tyre burst because as e dey move for road, e dey hot.
And di road dey hot.
Our weather again dey affect am.
So all dese things put togeda, and when you go enter gallop, pah!
You no know sey dis tyre don get mark, but when you reach front, e go burst.
So in di, you need to put your tyre, put air for di tyre wey go measure up.
And again, if your tyre don less (na one wey we dey call underinflation inflation), underinflation too dey affect tyre.
E dey worry tyre because when you carry load, when you enter inside di tyre, di motor, e go press dat tyre.
And you, you see sey di tyre dey chop for di two sides.
If you blow am too much, e go dey chop for di centre but if you...
You know di air, di air inside no plenty, e go dey chop for di, di...
See sey di two sides of your tyre go dey smooth, you go say aha dis tyre, I just buy am, e just dey smooth.
Di air wey dey inside your tyre, e no reach.
So you suppose check your tyre make e no overinflate, or under-... inflate.
Anoda ting wey we dey tell people, if you must drive o, if e be sey you must drive motor (you don buy motor, you get licence), make you no take alcohol alcohol, all dis ogogoro, all dis tings wey dem dey sell for road.
Because dose things get things wey dey affect person for body.
If you are, if you take alcohol, di way you go dey see go different from person wey no dey under any influence.
E go affect you.
You fit dey look front now say noting dey whereas somebody don enter your front.
Bicycle don, person don ride bicycle enter your front.
You no go see am because you don take something wey dey prevent you from seeing well.
And if you dey drive, you suppose, you, you.
We, we dey get wetin we dey say.
You drive with your eye, and see with your mind.
If you dey drive motor, na you you dey look o, but na your mind you take dey calculate everyting.
Look at di building here and dere.
Everywhere na about house, house, better house, better house, better house.
Our own no be wi-...
We no dey different dan, like dem.
Na still di same tin wey de be, na im we be.
So all dose kind ting, e no good.
E good meh, if, sey make e dey help your people, dey help di one, di people wey better pass, dey help people wey better pass you cause you no know where di help go come from.
So dis year, I know sey dis year, dis year no go pass me by.
And dis year, I don already know sey dis year na my year.
And na my year of testimony, my year of blessing, my year of divine med-... eh eh eh mercy na im be dis year.
So I know sey as dis year dey carry on so, me, I dey carry on dey follow am.
I dey bumper dey follow am.
Cause I know sey di way dis year be now, di way I dey look di year, I know sey di year dey sh-... go shine for my head.
So so I don cover everyting put for God hand dis year.
Sey I know sey no how wey dis year no go better for my life.
So I dey pray sey as dis year be now, moh we start am.
People wey no learn work (because security work no be work), if you know sey your age still dey you for make you learn work, you better go learn work.
If na business, you enter business.
Anyone wey e know sey im go carry you, e carry you go.
Because security work, people don do am, I don jam some people.
Me, na three months now.
Na me, I don do am, but dat three month don dey me like sey na hundred years.
Some people don say de don do am twenty years, carry am marry wife, born five children, born ten children, no house.
De no even get place wey de dey put head dey lie down which no good.
So anybody wey know sey...
Tings wey im go do, e go favour am.
If na work, we go learn.
If na boy, time still dey your hand, you go do boyi.
Boyi no dey favour, but e get people wey im dey favour.
But when you calm your hand down, but it's better meh you go learn work.
Spend time!
Like four, five years, you don get your own.
Before you know, two to three years, you don relax.
E don dey do big boy, don buy machine, rent house, buy property put for house, begin dey bubble like oders.
But now wa-... di way im dey us now, we need quick money.
Ego buta, na im we need now.
To go carry di money come, na im we need.
Because di way we dey look di world now, e be like sey don even late for us sef.
But I know sey e never late.
But I know sey God go do am.
God go do am for us because our moder for village, de born us meh we help dem.
And as we born for poor family, no money.
De no even give us money moh we take carry come.
Na our hand na im de dey look.
December don pass now, we no go.
New year pass, we no go.
And de still dey look for us.
No how wey you land now, you no go buy bread, no how wey you go village, you no go buy bread.
You go buy wrapper for your moders, still give your moder pocket money like five thousand, ten thousand.
Meh di woman dey take am, dey smile say ehn im son come back.
And you con come go empty handed.
Money no dey, noting dey.
Nna e go con be like sey your own dey different.
But I know sey dis year, all dose tings go pass.
Dis year, any boy wey dey go travel dis year...
Now January, na im we dey.
From now till December, everyone go buy motor.
Before you go go home sef, if dey go dey drive dey go, tipper, about fifty tippers wit sand go dey follow you.
One trailer of eh cement dey go dey follow you so dat people go know sey yes people wey de forget for many years, God don remember dem.
Sey no be our own case?
Our own case no dey different.
And our God hand no dey too short to save us.
And ehn im, im dey hear our cry everyday.
Im dey hear our prayer everyday, but I know sey everybody get im own time wey be sey God dey dey bless am, everybody get im own time wey be sey God say ti-... today is your own day.
Sey you receive your own.
And I know sey God go do am for us.
So we no go.
If we dey look person meh person do you, dat mean sey you no go get am.
Instead wey your broder go do for you sef, e go carry am go do for anoder person.
Or e go tell you sey meh you waka go find your own, sey im ma, don find im own.
So if you dey look for person now meh person do for you, dat mean sey you no go get am for life.
So anywhere wey you know sey you go put to head, you put to head o.
And di way...
Anywhere hard.
Put to head now!
No be sey anyhow head.
E get place wey you go put head sef, dat place go kill you, e get place wey you go put head kwa, dat place go favour you.
Ehn di way Nigeria be now, nobody know where im go put head.
You no know wheder you go put your head for politics, or make e put head for business, or moh we put head for conductor, abi na business, abi na boyi, abi na which one?
Di one wey we put head now don dey put our head.
Dat one wey even kill, e don already kill us.
But de will still remain one bar, and one bar now go still be full bar.
Hm!
So as I dey talk now, na God hand na im I carry am put sey God go do it for us dis year.
And as we dey talk am today wey be di tenth of January two eighteen, and na so God dey, go take carry am on till di year two thousand and twenty.
And as we dey start today dey talk am so, boy, im dey reach God ear, and im dey hear am.
And na so...
E say anyting wey we talk say in Jesus name, na so shall it be.
And na so im go mark am.
So as we dey talk now, we don put am for God hand say im go do well for us in Jesus name.
Amen!

Hmhm.
As eh, base on di strong Warri girl wen a be, staunch Warri babe wen a be, we dey like banga soup, and starch.
Banga soup, and starch na our correct food.
Wey be sey any time you enter inside our field like dis, if you never see banga soup, and starch inside Ewere pot, you need to go, and ask yoursef oder question.
So today, today now, a go just tell you how you go take get your banga soup, and starch ready for your side.
Number one, you need to get your banga.
Banga, na im de dey call palm nut uhm.
Na, when you get your banga, e get di spices wey dey make di banga soup be banga soup.
And dat spices, dem dey call am irogoje, anoder one, de dey call am otaiko.
Anoder one, we dey call am inyanyan, anoder one, de dey call am peletete.
And to crown am all, you go put your bitterleaf inside so dat when you start to dey chop am like dat, e go just dey flow dey go.
Okay now, see wetin you go do!
Once you buy your eh tins when you go market now, if na fish you wan to use o, no problem.
For inside Warri, we dey like to use fresh fish, catfish.
And di kind of catfish wey we dey use, no be di one wey be sey de don feed for pond.
Na di one wey come out from inside river, fresh one like dat.
When we buy am come like dat, we go knack am, take eh knife knack di head of di fish.
Or we go put salt inside, we go come cover am.
When we put am like dat, only di fish go die on im own.
Den wetin we go do?
We go remove di belle.
Dat one na for di fish o.
Now, when you reach market, you don buy your banga, you don buy your otaiko, your rogoje, your beletete, your inyanyan, your bitterleaf.
Now, all dese tins wen a call now so, all of dem na spices.
Wetin you need to do?
You need to ground dese your spices because you no go fit carry di spices toss throw inside your soup like dat.
So you go take your ba-... your rogoje, you go take your otaiko, you go take your inyanyan.
You go put dem inside your blender.
If you not get blender, put am inside grounding stone.
Den ground am.
Make e dey smooth well, well.
Den put am for corner.
Now, anoder tin wey you go use, you go use your dry pepper for inside dis very soup.
Because if you go use any oder kind of pepper, e fit no give you dat smell, dat aroma wey e suppose to give you.
So you go use your dry pepper.
Now, for your pepper now, you go ground your dry pepper too, put am for corner.
You go use cube o because dis cube wey de dey call...
Eh, a no wan call any name now so dat you no go say na di one wen a call you go use.
Cube na cube.
Any kind of cube.
You go use cube too for inside dis your food.
So you go put your cube for corner.
You still need crayfish.
Hm?
But di crayfish wey you go use now, no be sey na plenty crayfish wey come overpower di smell.
So s-... shekele crayfish, na im you go just use.
You go still ground your crayfish, put for corner.
Now, make we cook di banga soup sharp, sharp, sharp.
Wetin you go do?
You don get palm nut wey be your banga so.
Carry your banga put for inside fire.
No buy agric banga o.
Buy native banga because native banga go give you di correct oil wey you wan.
Agric banga go only thick.
And e no go make di soup sweet.
Toh buy native banga.
How you go take know native banga in case you want to know?
Just take hand press am like dis.
Native banga no dey full.
Once you just use hand touch am like dis, e go just come out small, but agric banga, before you go do am like dis sef, e don tear, and di flesh, e dey plenty well, well.
Dat na di difference between native, and agric.
But again, anoder style dey o.
Because your native banga, e no dey quick dey thick.
You go cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, e no go thick.
But if you want make e quick thick, you fit get like small of your agric banga, join am wit di native banga.
But make sure sey your native banga, e plenty pass your agric banga.
Okay now, carry dat your banga now so wen a don tell you put for fire.
When you put am for fire, thirty minutes pakan, your banga, e don done.
If you dey use charcoal dey cook, twenty minutes sef, because of di fire, e don done.
Once your banga done, carry am like dat, put am inside your mortar.
You know sey di mortar, e get pikin.
Ehen mortar, e get pikin.
Put your banga inside di mortar.
Use di pikin, take am take beat di banga.
Knack am well, well.
When you knack finish, put water inside, take your hand, wash di banga, wash am well, well.
When you wash finish, collect di eh eh water for inside di banga, put am inside your pot.
When you put am inside your pot, carry am on top of your stove.
Allow am make e boil for ten minutes.
Once e dey boil for ten minutes, no waste time at all, at all.
Dat your pepper wey you don ground so, turn your pepper inside.
Take small salt.
Put your salt inside.
Dat your salt wey you go put, and your pepper wey you go put, e go make di oil wey dey inside your banga stand on top of dat your soup.
Now once you don do dat one finish, you come wait small.
Carry your irogoje, your beletete, your otaiko, and eh your inyanyan wey you ground together so put dem inside your pot.
Allow dem make dem boil again for ten minutes.
After ten minutes, check am wheder e don dey thick small hm.
If e never thick small, still leave am.
Den di next tin wey you go do again, carry your ground crayfish put am inside.
Take your salt put inside.
When you put salt finish inside, na your fish e go be di last tin wey you go put.
Now, carry your fish put your fish inside.
Allow your fish make e dey boil.
Den once e boil, make sure sey when you turn di soup, not turn am anyhow, anyhow o.
You go turn dem small, small so dat your fish, e no go scatter.
Now, when you don put dat one finish, di next tin wey you go do now na your bitterleaf.
So carry your dry bitterleaf.
Put your dry bitterleaf inside.
When you put your dry bitterleaf inside, not put spoon again o.
Because if you put spoon, di soup, e go come bitter.
So put your dry bitterleaf inside.
Den allow am make e boil on im own for five minute.
No put spoon inside.
After five minutes, carry your spoon, take am take turn your banga soup.
Den still allow am make e dey boil dey go.
Since na native banga you dey use, e no go quick dry.
Now, di next tin wey you go do, na our local pot wey we dey use for inside Warri.
De dey call am Ewere pot.
Uhm e don make me remember my mama, and my papa for house.
Okay dat your Ewere pot so, you go come carry your Ewere pot, put am on top of your stove.
Allow fire make fire beat di Ewere pot well, well.
If fire done beat am well, well, take your spoon.
Take your banga soup wey be sey still light for inside pot.
Put am inside your Ewere pot.
Carry your fish put am inside.
Allow di fire make e beat di soup inside di Ewere pot for three minutes.
After three minutes, carry your Ewere pot, put am for ground.
Den di last tin, na your starch.
Starch, na our local food wey we take dey chop di banga.
And dat starch, e dey get am from inside cassava cassava wey de take dey do gari.
So dat your starch na, just put your starch inside water.
Carry your frying pan, put small oil inside.
When you put starch, put enough water wey you go take know sey dis starch, e no go strong, or di starch, e no go too dey light.
Di next tin wey you go do, carry your starch inside your pot.

E go take only ten minutes for your starch to gum body together.
If your starch don ready, carry your starch down.

Ehn good afternoon!
My name na Oke Lucent Akporube.
I be musician, I be drummer, I dey play drum, and I dey very good for di drum wey I dey play.
And how I take, how I take start, how I take reach di level wen I dey now, I bin get dis passion for music when I small.
As children now, when you go church, you go just go church.
Di one wey dey hungry you, wey you like, wey your eyes dey, na im you go go to learn.
Den, wey we small, my father dey go Assembly, Assemblies of God.
So when we go church di drummers, di instrumentalists dere, dem make announcement for church sey if you wan learn instrument, musical instrument, come church con learn!
So we now, we go to learn.
So you know dis politics for church, all dese ehn guys, dem dey choose, dem dey look di people deir parents get money to teach di children.
So de don select all di children finish.
But me, with determination, I say any how e be, dis thing, I must play am at di age of four.
I go go church, I go go to play.
Dem go collect drum stick for my hand, say get out from here!
You, your father pay money?
All dose ones, I say okay no wahala!
Wit cry, I go cry go house, come back again, dem go still pursue me.
Either de comot di pedal, or de collect di drumstick.
So now, if I dey go, I go carry pedal wey I do with my hand, and carry stick for my pocket.
When I reach church, de collect deir stick, and deir, di pedal, I go put my own pedal, carry my stick, dey play small, small, small, small, small, small.
De go come, de go hear am again, de go pursue me again.
I go comot for dere.
So I get to go house.
Di seat, my, di chair for my house, dem get wooden hand all dose old school chairs, and foam wen dey rest your back.
So and my floor, if you match am, e dey sound like bass drum.
So na dere I come dey learn with toothbrush.
Everyday, I dey practise, I dey practise, I dey practise.
So e get one day, di drummer no con come church.
De come dey find who go play drum.
As I small (na at di age of, den, I don dey play, I don reach six years), na I sit down for drum, I come play dat day.
De come dey ask sey haha na which person pikin be dat one?
My father, with pride, e con come outside say na my son o!
Dis, de come say ah your son dey try o!
So with dat level, I just dey learn small, small, dey learn till I con dey go different churches, go dey play.
So when I reach eight years, I don begin dey play for church.
I don dey make small, small money.
So I no get time to go dey tell my father sey I wan buy dis, I wan buy dis.
So I just dey assist am.
Though, my family, den I understand di way things dey, but at a stage, when I con (at which year sef, nineteen ninety five), when I enter secondary school, I con meet one guy.
Di guy dey play drum, dey play bass, dey play everything.
I come just make am friend.
We just dey play.
Everytime we go im house.
Even bass guitar sef, I dey play bass guitar.
I be, I dey very good with bass guitar too.
But as my brother come dey learn bass guitar, I get to comot hand for dere so dat make e use dat one take dey do im own.
Den, me, I just focus on di drum.
So I con dey play.
But e get one boy wey dey my street, everytime, we dey play.
When I dey play drum, when I see where de dey play drum all di children, de go do church.
You know sey children sabi do church now, dem go just gather dey sing, people go dey play.
So me I go just go, go dey play as if ah na me sabi play pass.
But dis boy, all of us dey dey...
You no go ever see dis boy come outside say e dey play anything.
I know sey dis boy na wizard for drum.
E don rehearse, e don tight well, well.
One day, my church (I dey Redeem den), de con say de look for drummer for headquarter.
Before I know, I see dis boy dey play drum.
When I hear di boy dey play drum, I begin fear.
Di boy so play pass, e play pass everybody for di church.
I say ehen so dis guy (e name na Kevwe)... I say so you dey play drum, you dey hide am since, so no wahala!
Because of dat boy, I decide to do all night rehearsal for two years every night till I o...
I dey go church every Monday.
I go go by ten o'clock in di night.
I go rehearse till four o'clock in di morning.
Den I come back.
As I reach house, I just do one, or two things, just arrange myself.
I go go school.
As I come back from school, stay small, sleep.
Den, for night, I go go evening service.
As soon as service close, I come house, go back to church again.
Every Mondays to Fridays, every week (apart from Saturdays and Sundays), for dat kind one year, na im give myself.
Di next time wey me, and di guy meet, di next year, di boy see am say power don jam power.
Im get to relax for me.
So im say de con remove am from di headquarter church.
De con make me di drummer.
I con tell dem sey no.
No be my lifestyle to dey do all dose things, but, all my life, na church I don dey play.
Di time wey I just mistakenly say okay, I come get one misunderstanding for my church.
I say okay, make I just get, meh I go try dis secular music, dis secular, meh I see as e be.
I con say okay meh I try dis club.
As I try club, I play for club for at least three months.
Dat three months so, na me know wetin I see, where di person go smoke pour cigar for your f-... face.
All dose, and me, I no like all dose things.
But, God himsef come warn me seriously sey meh I no try am again go play for club.
How you take do am?
Be sey e come be, I come fall sick.
For dat kain two months, I no fit do anything.
So when I go church, come go back to my church, come go meet my pastor say make e no vex for wetin happen.
So I don come back.
Immediately dat day, I get one dream.
So for di dream, I see somebody, one woman give me tri-...
E give me some...
I don dream see di woman.
Di woman give me something, I collect am.
As I dey go so, I no know sey dat dream, na im make me dey sick.
So as di pastor preach I receive, but you can recall your dream, and return anything you collect from anybody, I say ehen!
So I con recall di dream, I wait.
As small pikin, naim I come pray.
Dat night, I see di dream.
I con see di woman.
Di woman don give me meat, di woman don dey go.
Naim I call am back.
I say madam, come take your thing now, use am!
Throw am give di woman, di woman catch it.
Di next, as I wake up, I begin sweat.
After dat day, I get mysef.
So since den, till I con come Port-Harcourt con begin dey play for my church wey I dey now, till date, I never go any church go play.
So if na commitment, ehn if God dey, if God dey bless person because of wetin e dey do, ah I no know sha because I no be God.
Cause I dey see God blessing everyday, but I go, I go...
Ting I dey try to talk be sey music, if you no like music (because personally, music is my life), if you comot music for my life now, I don finish.
So my life is all about music, and God.
So dat is what I have, see and na only wetin I wan tell you.
My advice to anybody wey dey do music, make e do di right thing wey know sey e go make God bless am, and bless people wey dey listen to am.
Thank you!
Good afternoon people wey dey listen to me!
I want to talk to una about a man called Jesus.
Una don dey hear about am, but a lot of una no get any relationship wit am.
Dis person wey im name na Jesus was im di person wey God send.
God na di person wey we dey worship, wey dey like your papa wey born you for earth.
As your papa born you, feed you, train you, house you, na so, our God for heaven, na im bring im own son too wey im name na Jesus come tell us sey if we must come to him, we go come through dis Jesus.
But Jesus no just come like dat.
According to di Bible for, in, in ehm John chapter three verse three, a man name Nicodemus go meet Jesus one day, con ask Jesus sey I dey see di tings wey you dey do since you come.
You dey do so, so good work for people life.
People life dey better.
Di one wey get blind eye, im eye go see, di one wey no fit eat, you dey give am food, di one wey no get leg, you dey fit make am waka.
Dis ting wey you dey do, I like am so much.
Your mind, you dey good.
You love people very well.
You no dey discriminate about poor, or rich.
Everybody, you dey carry dem along.
I want to begin to do dis kind ting wey you dey do.
Jesus con answer am sey yes it is very possible for you to do wetin I dey do, but dere is a condition.
E con ask Jesus sey wetin be di condition wey go make me dey do like you, dey enjoy dis privilege, dey enjoy dis benefit?
Jesus con tell am sey except you are born again, in John chapter three verse three.
Dat Born Again mean sey except you change your lifestyle to become like me, eh to do di, to...
Except you change your lifestyle, and begin dey tink of God, except you leave di old way wey you dey worship oder juju, oder tings, and begin dey worship di true God wey dey heaven, you no go fit do wetin I dey do.
Nicodemus come say aha how I born again?
Eh I go go back to my mama belle make she born me again?
I am, I am eighty five years.
I am old now.
Even my mama don die.
Jesus say no.
If you read di Bible, go read verse six!
E say no.
Dat except you are born of water, and of the spirit, you will not be able to enter the kingdom of God.
What is dat kingdom of God?
Na im be di message wey I carry come for una today.
Dat kingdom of God, na di ting wey God don prepare for heaven, wey we suppose dey enjoy even as we dey for earth before we go go meet am for heaven.
Dat kingdom of God, no sickness dey, dat kingdom of God, no disease dey, dat kingdom of God, no lack dey, dat kingdom of God, no poverty dey, dat kingdom of God, na only happiness, and Joy.
So Jesus con tell Nicodemus sey except you are born of the water, and of the spirit, you can not enter that kingdom.
Wetin be di water wey Jesus mean?
Di water mean sey except you dey, you know the Bible which is the word of God, den you no go understand who God is, you no go even know wetin God fit do for you.
So di way to enter di kingdom of God is to be born by dat water.
E now con use anoda phrase say and of the spirit.
Wetin be di spirit?
It means dat di inside, di real person wey be you, no be dis body wey you carry be you o.
No be your mind be you o.
Dere is a real person inside of you wey be di spirit.
And e say except dat spirit is also change, you can not also enter.
Wetin go change dat spirit?
Na the word of God.
Di, and how can di spirit be changed?
When you say make dat word of God enter your heart!
If you go back to Gen, eh John's gospel chapter one verse one, Bible say in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.
So dat word wey di Bible dey talk about, na im be di person of Jesus.
Jesus say I come in the volume of what?
Di books.
So everyting wey you dey read for Bible, you dey read about Jesus.
And for you to see dat kingdom wey Jesus dey tell Nicodemus, you must take dat word into your heart.
And wetin be di word wey we dey talk about?
According to John chapter one verse one, dat word, na im be who?
Jesus Christ.
Which means, except you accept Jesus into your life, you cannot see di kingdom of God.
People now wey dey enjoy di benefit of God, de dey live in good health, de dey live in prosperity.
Dere is no sickness in deir body, no, no lack.
God dey bless dem yafun, yafun.
Everyting de put deir hand, di ting dey go ya, ya very well.
De da...
De dey see di kindness of God, de no dey go hospital today, de no dey sick, tomorrow arthritis, dey headache next tomorrow.
No!
Everyting about deir life dey very good.
Na because de don accept Jesus into deir life.
And Jesus say if you accept me into your life, Nicodemus, you go begin to see di kingdom of God begin to happen for you.
And Nicodemus say ehen?
So na so dis ting be?
And anoder ting wey di kingdom of God don come to do for us is dat di kingdom of God, where di kingdom of God dey, dis is light.
And where light dey, dere is no what?
Darkness.
So di kingdom of God is also di light of God.
When dat light come inside where darkness dey, wetin go happen?
Darkness go disappear.
Just remember when NEPA take light for your house.
When you on your lantern, or your candle, wetin happen?
You go see everywhere.
Na so di light of God dey.
When light come into your life, wetin go happen?
All di ting wey the Devil don put for your body, all di yama, yama, the light of God go make all of them to what?
Disappear.
So di vital message for today is that the kingdom of God (like Jesus say) is near you, but how can you access it?
How you go enter dat kingdom?
Until you receive Jesus into your life.
My broder, my sister, as many of una wey dey listen to me, if Jesus never come into your life, your life go still dey in crisis.
Your life, you go still dey get pain, and problem here, and dere.
But when Jesus don enter come sit down, you con say Jesus, you are my lord o, from today, anyting you tell me, now, I go do.
Den from dat day, you go begin to see the glory of God in your life.
You go begin to see wetin e mean to live in the kingdom of God.
God bless you as you accept am into your life!
In Jesus name, amen!

Na here we be to come inside di waka dis morning.
Tomorrow morning, we go bring onto una.
E come to mean sey every, inside ministry of sportology, una get to hear am.
On to di behalf of di biggest one ah, my name na Triple A.
Abeg, help me tell somebody wey dey near you, and dose one wey im far meh people no lost, meh im quarrel for no day.
Baba God dey.
Bless your heart!
My name na Dondeli Obi, and eh I come from Onitsha Ukwuani for Ndokwa West Local Government Area of Delta State here for Nigeria.
I bin go primary school for Aido Primary School, Onitsha Ukwuani before I con go secondary school for Mixed Secondary School, Onitsha Ukwuani.
When I finish from secondary school, I con go Federal Polytechnic Auchi, go study electrical, electronics engineering.
But now, I dey work wit ehm Wazobia FM for Abuja.
We dey use ehm Pidgin dey do radio work for di station.
And ehm even dough sey na engineering me I choose to do for school, people go dey ask sey ah wetin you dey find for radio house, or broadcasting?
But ehm di tin be sey na talent, and wetin you sabi, no be wetin you learn.
So I love to do eh broadcasting.
No be because sey na wetin I study for school, or wetin I dey study, but na because na wetin I like to do, na wetin I get talent for to do.
Na im make me dey do am.
And I love di job as in wit all my heart.
I love di job.
I dey dey happy sey I dey do di work.
In fact, if I dey go work, I no dey prepare from house comot say I dey go work.
I dey prepare comot say I wan go enjoy mysef.
I wan go play because I see di work as na part of me, na sometin wey dey inside me.
I no dey struggle to do am, dey very easy for me to do.
So but I still dey aspire sey I go continue again wit my education because ehm I feel sey so many tins dey to do wit life, and eh I still believe sey education go help me well.
But anyway di Pidgin wey I dey speak, I no go learn am for anywhere.
I no, e no get any particular place wey I go say okay make dem teach me Pidgin.
I learn Pidgin from people wey dey around me, from my day to day activities, tins wey I dey do everyday, people wey I dey mix up with, di way dem dey talk.
I no get any choice dan to flow join dem so dat me sef go fit dey communicate with dem.
So I learn di Pidgin, and I find out sey naturally, for Delta State, di South, South area of Nigeria, Pidgin na one of di languages wey everybody dey take talk.
If you wan know general language wey everybody sabi for di whole South South, na Pidgin English language so.
E dey easy for me to learn am when I dey dere because na di language wey everybody dey speak.
Dey generally accepted.
So I no go any school of Pidgin.
Nobody call me sit down sey eh dis na classroom.
Oya sidown, make I teach you how de dey speak Pidgin!
But today, I dey speak Pidgin pass any other language, even my own language.
I speak Pidgin more pass di language.
So Pidgin, no be sometin wey you go go school go learn, or sometin.
Na inbuilt.
As dem born you, you dey grow up dey mix up with people, e dey natural wit you.
And ehm as a young man, I s-... I know sey I get plenty opportunities wey dey wait for me for front, and I get eh plenty ambitions for my career, and also for my country.
You know walking as a broadcast journalist wey I dey do now, I don see sa-... I don, e don expose me to see so many tins.
And I dey see tins from different angle now.
Both di way tins dey happen for our society, or politics, and every oder part of life for our country.
And me I get dat mind say I fit also contribute my own to make di society, and our country make e for better.
I get mind say I go join politics.
I go do politics soon because I find out sey if I get di plans, di ambitions, and eh di opportunity no come, I no go fit contribute my own quota.
So I feel sey if I join politics, by God's grace, I go fit contribute my own to bring development for our country, Nigeria because di way tins dey for Nigeria now, (truth be told, make we talk di truth) tins no dey work.
And di reason why tins no dey work, na im we dey try to find out so dat we go fit know di best solution to everytin wey no dey work for Nigeria.
So for me, as young man wey dey come up, I dey watch event of tins, how tins dey happen for our country, how our leaders wey dey now dey do tins.
I dey find out, dey know how dem take dey do deir tins, dey know deir mistakes, what dem, di tins wey de suppose do, wey de no dey do, di tins wey de no suppose do wey dem dey do.
I dey watch everytin wey dey go on, and I also dey follow up wit di tins wey dem dey plan to do.
So for me, I go get more advantage dan di leaders wey dey now because I no believe sey di leaders wey dey now, dem start dis politics tin early.
Dis leadership eh tin den, at, I no sure sey dem start am early.
If to say dem start am early, de for don sidown, look wetin before leaders do.
Di mistakes wey dem do as dem come, dem go fit avoid am.
But wetin we get for Nigeria today, na sey dis leadership go come, de go lead Nigeria.
When deir time finish dem go comot.
Di next one go come, de go carry Nigeria from where di oder person stop.
De go carry am from dere.
But di same mistake wey di b-... b-... oder leaders dem do when dem dey, di new ones go come in, dem go still dey make di same mistake.
So, dat means when di oder leaders dey, when de never dey power, de no dey watch how di oder leaders take dey do deir own leadership.
De no dey take note of all di mistake wey dem dey make.
And de no dey even get plan, no agenda sey if I come office, na wetin I go do be dis.
Now, when de don finally enter power, na dat time de go come sidown begin dey tink wetin dem go do.
And if you walk a-... look am, e go be like sey mtschew dem be, dem dey confuse.
De no know wetin to do.
Why?
Because before de enter power, dem be no get plan.
De enter power, come dey find plan.
So dem go dey dere dey find plan.
By di time dem go find plan finish, deir time don finish.
Anoder person go enter again.
Di person wey go enter again go begin find plan, e go begin dey work on di mistakes wey di oder people don make, e go continue to make di same mistakes.
Den eh dat one go finish, anoder person go come.
So wetin we need now na people wey sabi, people wey dey exposed, people wey know about tins wey don happen before.
Both tins wey dey happen now, and den, dem go get solution, tell Nigerians sey na dis tin be our problem.
Na dis tin be our problem.
Na dis tin we go do make dis problem stop for our Nigeria so dat Nigeria go move forward pass as e dey now.
So for me, eh dat ambition, e dey alive, and eh wit God I believe sey e go come true.
Ehm for me, to move Nigeria forward, na make we understand ourselves.
Ehm plenty tings dey separate Nigerians dem.
And na until we unite wesef, na when we come put hand togeder, join body togeder na im we go fit move tings forward.
Wetin I dey try talk about, when Igbo man no go see imsef just as Igbo man, when Yoruba man no go see imsef as Yoruba man, where Hausa man no go see imsef as Hausa man, when Itsekiri no go see imsef as Itsekiri, when Rivers person no go see imsef as h-... Rivers person.
Make everybody see demsef as Nigerian first before deir tribe.
Den until we get dat level, e go hard for us.
Because how you go... ?
You go see youths dem wey dey certain area go talk sey no una be, una no be our people, una must comot for our side.
E no make sense.
Because if you check, no place wey dey for dis country, wey no one tribe enter.
Shey na Lagos you wan mention?
Abi na Abuja?
You go see all di tribe dem for inside dis state.
You enter Enugu, di same ting, you enter Lagos, di same ting, you enter even Rivers, di same ting, abi na Calabar, di same ting.
Di ting wey join us togeder, na di country.
And we don dey inside the country togeder right from Imo river.
Na until we fit comot dat dirty from o.
And na just some people dem wey be sey because of deir selfish gain, wetin de gain selfishly, na im dey make dem meh dem dey put sand, sand, no just want make people dem develop.
And but di funny ting be sey social media wey don dey ground now don open eyes of plenty people dem.
Some may open deir eyes in di right way, some may open deir eyes in di wrong way.
Because dese people dem wey be sey de get selfish gain, dem mahnsef understand sey dat social media, if dem mahnsef no jump ontop am, de say di people dem wey be sey, de dey control go loss.
Naim de enter inside social media, don begin dey do some kind campaign.
You go see WhatsApp.
Person go just...
E go compose one kind nonsense post, spread am, make everybody hear am.
People wey be sey dey read am, de no go take time confirm.
De go just read am like dat, begin spread am up, and down as eh amebo rumour mongers dat de is now, begin dey eh sh-... eh share am from one person, to di oder, just dey plant evil seed inside eh different people dem.
Before you know anyting, person go just see im fellow human being wey come from anoder tribe, e go begin vex for am.
Sake of wetin?
Sake cos sey de no be from di same tribe.
But for us to move forward, na for di youth dem to understand sey, dat one tin wey be sey de dey give dem say okay if election come o, take go vote for me, take go scatter dis, take go thief ballot box, until we realize sey we dey mortgage (when I say mortgage, na grammar), we dey sell we future.
We need to understand sey di future, na now, no be tomorrow.
All dat one wey de dey tell us sey di future, di leaders of tomorrow, na di youth dem, no o.
Di leaders of today na di youths.
No be tomorrow.
Take for example France!
Abi na which country I wan begin dey call?
Young, young people don dey enter inside power.
Meh di old people dey advice, meh di young people dem dey work.
Yes we know sey we need di old people dem because de don see am, and de talk sey you no fit get experience without seeing am.
De fit dey advice while di young people dem dey work.
Na di only way we fit move forward be dat o.
Well di matter of eh restructuring, and wey some people dey talk sey some people na stranger for deir community, de no suppose dey dere.
If you check, some of di biggest investments, for some areas...
Make I take example for Kogi State wey I do my secondary school, Eda to be precise.
Dat time, one of di biggest boutiques wey dem get, wey dey sell cloth, and oder, oder tings dem, wey person dey wear for body, na Igbo person get am.
No be person wey be sey na from dat tribe get am.
Until we understand sey yes o, we get we own!
But we no fit do everyting togeder.
As motor take be reach, no be di same company wey dey do di car do everyting.
E must join body with oder people dem to fit complete wetin de need.
Di electrical, di mechanical, di oil.
De fit no dey produce di oil, but de go meet people dem wey be sey de produce oil, join hand togeder.
Take for example farm mahnsef.
If farmer plant eh cassava, cassava grow, e comot am for ground, e go carry am for head go market?
E go enter motor.
E fit be sey no be im get di motor mahnsef.
Na anoder person dey drive di motor.
E fit be sey di person wey dey drive di motor no be im tribe person.
Na until we understand dese little, little tings dem say na small, small na im we fit join body togeder take achieve wetin we dey find.
We no fit just dey, dey, just dey, dey form sey okay, we go do am, we go do am we own.
No island...
Abi no man be island.
You need your broder as you need your sister, and likewise as you need your mama, and papa to take move forward.
So all dat talk of sey stranger, stranger, na lie.
Who be di richest man now for Africa?
No be Northerner?
We know sey all di...
E get some oder people dem wey be sey de get money, but no dey loud am.
But until we decide sey yes o, dis person, if we don see sey im fit help us develop we land, den we accept am, e develop di land, we gain for inside am.
Im mahnsef gain for inside am.
Plenty investment by people dem wey be sey de invest.
Check for example Dangote now, di richest man for Africa.
No be Lagos now e don dey plan to build refinery?
E tink of im side?
Most of im company no be Lagos?
Because e don see sey di capacity no dey dat side.
E fit be sey because of nearness to di raw materials, e build am for dat side.
E no fit talk sey okay because now eh you get money, you want build refinery, you carry am go build for inside desert?
How you wan take collect di oil?
You go go di people dem wey get di oil, talk to dem, do agreement wit dem, den move forward.
But because of wetin don dey happen for past, plenty people don feel sey oh because eh some people wan come collect wetin dey deir land, de no settle down gist to dem compensate dem.
Even dough sey dem put am for paper, de no put am for...
Some people wey be sey de even go represent dem, when e reach where de suppose talk, de go just carry small change put for deir back pocket.
De go say ah mtschew e don try.
De close mouth.
So na all dese tings dem we need to do.
Reorientation.
Begin dey teach di people make de understand until we reorientate di youth dem.
Tell dem sey see as e be, see as e be!
Make de understand really.
No be di one wey be sey de brainwash dem.
Tell dem di honest truth.
Den, we go move forward.
All di talk of stranger, dey go push go one side, and allocate wetin suppose be for Mista A meh e be for Mista A.
Wetin suppose be for Mista B, meh e be for am.
No be when you carry Mista B own go tief, go give Mista C.
E no dey work like dat.
Dis one get...
Okay quickly, make una still remember sey every Wednesday, body matter, na im we dey always carry troway give una.
We don comot for di ehn gist of ehn body matter.
Right now, na di topic we wan troway.
Den once is twelve o'clock, remember by di grace of God, Dr Sam go join us inside studio a gyneacologist.
By one p.m., make una still remember Isaac Onoja, pharmacist Isaac Onoja too go join us inside studio.
Maybe we fit talk about anger again, or we fit not still talk about anger.
But we get a lot of things to talk about as far as sey you, and me dey concern.
Because de say knowledge na power, and knowledge too na deliverance.
E dey very, very important.
I remember sey you wey dey for dere, wey be sey dey talk say disease no dey kill black man.
Or may be sometimes (I dey come, I dey come), you never go check your body, begin dey check your body.
Because out of ignorance, our people dey perish no be small.
But we need to dey do di right thing.
Dat is why both newspaper, magazine, television, radio, even some people wey dey ehn ehm post flyer, and for social media, you go see how everybody dey post body matter issue so dat you go learn.
But one thing wey be sey me, I go beg una, no be every body matter story you go dey read.
Because right now, some people go come don dey claim doctor.
Di main doctor never even talk about di thing, but im don already do one kind writeup.
Ehn if you mix dis, and dis, e go good for your body.
If you take dis, or you don take dis, or you do like dis, or you do like dat, please, please, and please, meet di professionals so dat de go tell you wetin dey.
Yes.
Okay quickly, ehm make una still remember sey we still get limited time concerning di topic wey we carry come.
Now di body matter topic wey we carry come, we go just manage our time.
E get so many things wey be sey you don hear from your friend, or you, you read am for social media.
De tell you sey if you take dis one, e dey good for your body.
Tell me most of di thing wey you don hear.
At di end of di day, all dese thing na fake story, fake story, fake story.
Now you fit add dis issue of di one wey be sey I tell una.
E get one of our callers wey call us for here.
Dis women, di woman carry im pikin.
Two of dem dey hospital, as in inside hospital o.
De admit deir pikin.
Now one of di woman wey dey inside dat hospital con tell im fellow woman sey madam, aha eya wetin do your pikin?
Dey tell am sey na dis one dey do am, na dis one dey do am.
Now imagine di oda woman come tell am sey ah if dis one dey do my pikin, see wetin I dey give am now!
Now dis woman wey dey inside hospital, con comot inside hospital, go buy dat medicine outside, come give am to im pikin wey de admit inside hospital.
Den before you know wetin go happen, dat pikin con die.
When doctors dem come begin dey try dey find out wetin dey, wetin no dey, de come find out sey dis woman, see wetin e give im pikin.
Madam, wetin happen?
E say na so, so, so woman na im tell am.
I think di woman even dey dere.
Na im tell am sey make e go buy dis thing.
Sey e go good for im pikin.
Your pikin dey inside hospital.

Okay now, my name na Jemaimah Efangha.
For all of una wey dey look una eyes dey see us for here, make una still get better, better day!
Una good afternoon!
Okay.
Ehn first bah, na for Abuja de born me.
De bin born me for Wuse General Hospital.
And dat was like, dat, dat, na like around eh nineteen ninety era ehen.
And since den, na Abuja I dey.
I did...
All my school na Abuja from primary, secondary to university.
Personally, I no dey like travel.
Road no be someting wey I dey like like dat.
Ehn but flight, I'm scared of height bah.
I dey fear.
If I climb anywhere wey high, I dey fear well, well.
But if I enter aeroplane, dat one dey sweet.
So e be like sey I dey like dat kind ting.
But na Abuja I dey troughout.
So even S, ehn Youth Service sef, na Abuja I do dat one, join.
Ehn Pidgin English no be someting wey we dey speak like dat for my house.
Actually, we no dey too speak Pidgin English like dat.
Ehn mumsy, pupsy, everybody, English or, our native language wey dey, wey be Wepawanu.
Cos na from Edo State I for come Etsako East Local Government ehn I-... Iyukui close to Aginnigbode.
For people wey dey travel de go know di road o.
Aginnigbode popular pass ehen.
So dat kind tings.
Bu-... bu-... no be like sey na Pidgin English we dey speak.
Funny enough, na me speak Pidgin English pass for house.
And na, na because sey I join Wazobia.
When I actually even come sef, ehn na me speak English pass for Wazobia.
But later, I gats con fine tune enter di ting.
Ehn na history I study for school.
So no be actually sey na like journalism I read.
But later, I con dey read up on am.
And I dey take oder courses wey relate to journalism.
But since na history I read, de say history na moder of all courses.
So dat one, e dey easy for person to take blend history wit any oder course.
So na why I just flow enter di matter like dat.
Den, research na someting wey I dey like.
So most times, I dey like read up on plenty, plenty tings, places, people, events, and tings.
So e dey, e dey really help.
And for dis kind job, e, e dey funny sha.
When you dey see big, big English, you go try con translate am enter di Pidgin wey people go fit understand.
Actually, dat na di hardest, hardest part wey we dey try explain someting wey dey very important.
But you go like make people wey no too know about am, make de know am, and make de no come misinterpret am.
Just like English wey people go get like one word for five different tings.
Like today sef we dey talk theatre.
We get theatre of war for military people, theatre wey de dey watch film, theatre wey de dey act.
Ehn we go even talk gallery.
Gallery na upstairs for building wey people would fit look down.
Ehen di gallery na where person fit go look picture.
Ehen so just like dat, Pidgin English get different meaning.
Person fit talk ehen?
Ehen, ehen!
And na still one ehen wey di person talk.
But dat ehen means different tings depending on how you take use am.
So all dose tings na wetin person go look.
Den also, ehn giving di time belt wey person dey work now, dis na children friendly hour.
Na office hour.
So de get some kind tings wey person no fit talk on air around dis type of time.
But de get some kind sensitive topics wey person go like treat.
But you gats dey mindful of di time wey you dey treat am, and wetin people wan hear from dat topic.
Den de get some kind words wey you, you go con form because just like English wey get coinage wey you fit eh pick one word and use am di way wey you fit.
De say everybody na im own.
Ehn you be your own creator of your own English ehen, but for Pidgin, if you create one word, you gats dey careful because de get how you go use am reach.
Before you know, person go start dey use am.
People go start dey use am for script.
Before you know, dat word wey you tink sey go, e no sell later, e fit con turn anoder ting.
So ehn na di ting and eh since Wazobia na like di people station, most popular station in Nigeria, and not just Nigeria, even in di North here, ehn people, people dey listen to us well, well.
So some kind, some kind words wey we don start don come turn lingo for street, everybody don dey use am.
So all dose tings still take follow join.
Ehn but for Pidgin English sha, di one wey we dey speak for Abuja here different from di one wey you go see for Port Harcourt, di one wey you go see for di western side.
Like most Pidgin for Abuja here, you go dey hear most tings wey...
Like if person wan talk exclamation now, you wan like, you go say na kai!
But dat's, dat, na Hausa word because sey na, na Abuja we dey ehen.
But for oder places, de fit use maybe Yoruba, or infuse small Igbo make di ting dey for sweet bottom.
Na so we dey take speak am for here.
Yes I dey travel.
Make I no talk sey na me travel pass o.
I no like road.
Ah we no get airport like dat wey go lead to my village so.
Even from, from Garki, to Gwagwalada sef, I go sleep throughout, talk more of Abuja, to Benin, ehn or Edo State hm.
So but I dey travel like once in a while.
Like every year, at least, I dey try sey at least once I dey enter, I dey enter state like two weeks, three weeks before I X comot.
Well, de...
Okay me I be, I be person wey dey like put hand inside plenty tings because I no believe sey person just suppose ehn dey one ting throughout your life.
De talk sey eh di average billionaire get more dan five job wey im dey do.
And me, I still young.
So I go like get like six to seven wey I dey do if average billionaire fit get five.
E go good if I get like seven, eight.
So I no go dey average ehen.
So e good to chook hand inside plenty tings.
But entertainment na di ting wey I don dey into since.
Even dough na arts I dey.
Before sef, na even fine art I be wan read.
But because dat year I dey draw.
Later from dat one, I come enter commercial class.
Na accountant wey I for wan like be.
But mtschew dat no come work out.
Na historian I come be.
But all dese tings still dey revolve around wetin dey from talking from secondary school, to inside university, to becoming an mc, master of ceremony, compare comedian.
All dose ones still take follow join.
But I come realise sey all dese tings dey push me towards where I still dey go.
So at di end of di day, artist management, talent management, na someting wey I really dey enjoy.
Event consulting, and management, and also setting up events, dat na wetin me, I dey also enjoy.
I also enjoy editing, I dey al-... also enjoy movies.
I be person wey like film well, well.
De no get film wey (if I see), wey I no like watch ehn.
And I dey like talk about am.
So I dey.
Anyting wey revolve around entertainment, na someting wey I dey like put hand into.
From inst-... from fashion o, music, dance, comedy, as long as sey na entertainment, my hand suppose dey inside.
Na wetin I believe.
So my hand must dey inside.
Den I dey also like talk.
I no dey like talk for talking sake.
Everybody get purpose for life.
And I dey try make sure sey anyting wey I comot from, anyting wey go comot from my mouth must impact person.
De dey talk sey in everyting wey, wey no serious, seriousness dey.
De say in every nonsense, sense dey.
I dey like meh my sense dey pass in nonsense.
So at least, if person hear you once, dat impression wey di person go get, because de talk sey first impression, na im dey last pass, so I dey like meh my first impression be good impression.
E get dis matter wey bin don dey ground, wey bin don dey talk about, if you remember.
Yeah.
Inside of di week wey waka pass, we bin hear some talk wey no too understand.
Like sey de dey reason sey de wan put five naira on top of fuel money.
Ehn no be only fuel.
Fuel, and diesel.
Ehn people con begin dey para sey food no dey ground, una wan add money again!
Na I say take am easy!
I know sey dat's eh inside of last week wen I bin dey talk sey make people take am easy.
Dat one, dat one, na on Friday na im e happen.
I know sey una no too trust me.
Because una con dey reason sey aha Titi, de wan put five naira, and you dey tell us make we take am easy.
Now, I go tell you why I bin tell us moh we take am easy last week Friday.
Di reason na because I trust di government of di state wey I dey inside.
Dat one na one.
I trust di government of di people wey me, I vote mey de representate me.
Dat one na two.
And di overall government nko?
I trust dem join.
Dat one na federal level.
You get so from federal, to state, to local government, to ward, and all di rest like, I trust dem.
You get I know sey de no fit do pass wetin we send dem.
You know di level now base on who you be.
Somebody say shut up Titi, you get mouth!
But seriously, I trust dem.
I trust sey bad as e bad reach, any decision wey de go make, de go think about us before dey make am.
You understand?
Ehn because all of us, we dey inside dis waka together o, we dey inside together.
You get di difference between me, and bros wey owes side now, na sey me, I dey buy one mudu of garri, e dey buy one bag.
Di price for market no dey different.
Na di price wey de sell give poor man na im de dey sell give rich man.
Di difference, na im be sey me dey buy small, small, and di big bros, dem dey buy bag, trailer, load, and all di rest.
You get?
But, dat one no mean sey bag of rice for poor man, e dey difference for bag of rice for rich man.
No!
De dey di same price.
So anything wey de wan do, de go think about us.
So dat one na why I bin tell you on Friday sey make you trust sey de go reason about di matter, and de no go just make any decision.
And I happy dis morning when I wake up wey I see sey de no just make just anyhow decision.
I bin tell you now!
Dey believe me if I tell you sey rain go fall for dry season!
Believe it!
You know wetin I see?
Why I go dey believe some kind things?
But, but you know serious, serious!
Comot joke for di matter!
So on top dat informate wey bin comot on Friday, now, I go tell you di tori as e suppose be.
You get because no be as e suppose be na im e later reach we side.
By di time wey di tori reach we side, some people don comot small, don add small.
De don put salt, de don put pepper, don put so many things.
You get to just make di story make e sell small.
But see di deal here.
According by di way wey Senate Commitee on Top of Works, dem chamo, Kabir Gaya wey dey representate APC Kano, di way wey e take yarn di matter, de no dey hear one side of tori judge o.
If you hear one side of yarn judge, you no be correct judge now.
You go hear here, hear dere, hear every, den you go come yarn di colour of your belle.
But right now, di tori, e different.
Because from wetin dey comot from di mouth of Oga Kabiru Gaya, im dey yarn sey, sey na true sey de sidon talk base on some kind bill wey de bin don dey judge, judge on top, on top of road matter.
Sey but dem no yarn sey di five, five naira go comot for di hand of me, and you.
So di next time wey you drive your motor to go sha mai for gidan mai, no be sey di five naira go comot directly from you.
Di five naira, na arrangy wey don dey ground e don tay.
Me, and you just no know about am.
You understand?
So according by di way wey di matter e suppose be, base on di arrangy of road fund bill wey de bin propose, wey di Commitee bin say okay make una re-... reason dis matter, mey una shook eye on top, you get e dey different from di tori wey reach country people side.
You understand di main, main thing, na im be sey na di people wey dey carry di oil enter.
You know sey we dey carry am raw, fresh as e comot for ground.
We dey carry am comot abi?
Den we go come go dust all di body, clean am up ehn, con carry am come back base on wetin me, and you fit buy.
You understand?
Ehen no be di crude na im de dey sell give us.
Meh carry di crude comot, polish am, dust am, cook am, dry am, do everything doable.
Ehen den con carry am come back, den con dey sell petrol, dey spe-... sell kerosine, dey sell diesel, gas, and all di rest like dat.
So wetin di Commitee on Top of Works bin dey judge on top, na unto sey as de dey carry am enter, di people wey dey carry am enter, di people wey dey sell am, so if pump price for filling station na one fourty five naira, dem no dey try talk sey di pump price go move from one forty five naira, to one fifty naira.
No!
De dey talk sey from dat one forty five naira, de go get di five naira wey de need for di arrangy of road fund.
Ehen you too okay!
Now di picture don dey resemble each other abi?
Now make I tell you di point where di tori e miss, where everything turn di way wey e turn.
You know sey you know us now.
No be today e don tay.
We dey wait for who go talk so dat we go para on top of im head.
You understand?
When Senate Commitee on Top of Works bin dey judge on top of di matter, e come get gombody wey hear about di matter, wey come provoke for di level.
Di name of di gombody na Conference of Nigerian Political Parties, alias CNPP.
Na dem come talk sey uhm de are here again, they have started again, let us shook mouth!
Naim de con zuga zugi zugi.
Ka zuga for Africa!
Naim de con zuga gombodi of organised ehn labour people.
Naim de come ginger dem say make una come, make una come!
We don hear fresh one hm.
De say de wan add pump price money, de wan put five naira on top.
Naim dose one too para.
Before we know wetin dey happen, gombodi of student too don dey para sey abeg, abeg, abeg labour people don dey vex.
Student too don dey para.
Na so di story reach we side kata giti kata.
Naim me too, I say eh de wan to add money to fuel price.
Alright now, make we get dese things straight.
Now, di gombodi of CNPP de dey drop accusate on top of di Head of National Assemble sey di people wey dey dere, de no dey reason us before de make any decide.
Sey de go just dey where de dey, just press deir, all di pressable, di computer, di phones, di everything, and dey just decide.
Sey de no dey really think about di common man, and you know wetin dey okay for us, and all di rest.
But from all dese gist wey I don give you, wey I don follow clear di tory wey we bin hear on Friday, di original tori wey we hear on Friday na sey ah Senate wan add to pump price, de wan add five naira.
But right now, dese same Senate dey comot now through di repre-... dem representate wey be chamo on top of Senate Committee for Works.
Yes Oga Gaya, im dey yarn sey no, no be so!
Dis bill, dis arrangy, dis road fund, apala pala thing, e don dey ground.
E don tay.
But di gombodies dem wey suppose dey pay am, de no dey pay.
You understand where di misunderstanding come follow show now?
Ehen because as de dey carry di oil come back inside country, de suppose eh as de dey sell give us, we, country people wey dey buy kerosine, fuel, diesel, and all di rest, gas, dey cook, and all di rest, dey drive motor, dey use generator, as de dey sell to us, from di money wey we dey pay dem, de suppose dey remit five, five naira.
So dat five, five naira, e don dey hang since ninety epurutepu.
Which person pocket now e dey enter?
Na di next question wey me I wan even ask.
Abeg, if de know, meh de tell us.
So if dat five, five naira no dey show, wetin happen to our five, five naira?
Because five naira is very important.
Last week ehn, okay on Saturday, I bin check my pocket, I see hundred naira.
That hundred naira change my life.
My life no remain di same after I see dat hundred naira.
And how many five naira dey inside hundred naira?
Just twenty.
So you know how, how many five, five naira ehen na im don dey dey since one no know where e enter?
Ehn dat one na for EFCC, and di, all di rest, and di SS people dere.
You know we love dem well, well.
Alright back to di matter.
Now, base on di calculate wey don dey ground, de dey follow yarn sey akpalapala don reach like one hundred, and sixty seven billion naira.
Dat five five naira o, dat five, five naira da muna adashi, had it been we dey do contribution (local contribution), do you know how rich we be now?
Yes, for, yes!
Maybe my pale go start di contribution before de born me.
You understand?
You know how much wey we go don get now?
So base on dat level, now I don come drop di matter for your front.
Wetin you feel?
Alright I carry di New Telegraph dis morning, and some of di stories wey dey dere, ehn wey dey different, I go read am out.
Ah you dey hear sey TELCOS dey lose big money.
De said de dey...
Di lose, abi di, di, di loss wey de don suffer, e don hit one hundred, and fifty six point six billion naira.
You know you have to stumble on some of di money (be-... be-... be-... billion) because we no know wheder na gazillion.

But right now, everything is up ehm to Emmanuel Macron as e now chopulate dis sixty five, sixty six percent of all the vote wey be sey de bin cast on top di matter.
Allright ehm and dat na di informate we don bring for una again today.
Yes and of course I no forget say on top any oda kind informate for Wazobia TV, our website dey dere, www dot Wazobia TV dot TV.
Make we enter our weather studio.
Make we see how weather go be for us dis beautiful morning.
My name na Jibike Ogunladi.
Port Harcout, una good morning!
My name na Silver Vick.
You know, I tell una sey very soon, I go celebrate one year anniversary wey I don dey come, I don dey teach una.
You understand?
And e get w-... where I bin stop last week, na dere I want start.
I...
Porico, I bin talk someting.
I bin, I bin dey give analysis of di average pikin for Africa, or Nigeria precisely wey dey go Nigerian university, in fact most of Nigerian university.
And I dey talk am, I dey talk am loud, I say I dey vex.
I say number one, it's very irrelevant for pikin to dey go university for country wey we dey sure sey no job dey.
You understand?
You know sey as you come out, no job just dey wait for you.
Dat na stupid investment.
Na so Oyibo call am.
Den for Pidgin English, na anyhow investment be dat.
You understand?
Now if children go dey go school for dis country, den people wey dey top go try very, very well make de dey provide job make de dey come out come work.
Because every average pikin na im p-... na im mama investment.
How e take be im mama, and papa investment?
Currently now, some parents dem dey work wetin we dey call civil servant job.
De go resume work by seven am, de go dey close by four.
Some of dem don dey di job, e don dey go forty years.
Where di money dey go?
De use am dey train some children for schools, and Nigerian universities wey dey graduate students dem wey no go everly dey economically relevant.
How?
You do mechanical engineering, you graduate, you no open bonnet.
How you take do di engineering?
You no even see engine sef.
You do mathematics, di lecturer wey dey teach you, on di average, you better pass am.
Na just one, or two few private universities just dey help di matter, and some wey be sey even if you want enter den you con even check di process to enter di school sef.
Di real one wey deir brain strong no dey reach enter because if you no pay for di malpractice, you no reach enter.
Den di ones wey enter, na money de take dey even corrupt di lecturers, dey sort everyting.
Den I come dey take assessment on average pikin.
How e take be investment?
An average pikin wey dey three months old, on feeding budget alone, for three months from nine months pregnancy, you dey look budget of over three hundred, and fifty thousand.
Na im im fader don spend.
So if you see pikin of ten years old, na over fifteen million naira feeding budget you dey see so.
Den when you see man of twenty five years old, dat is over sixty five million naira feeding budget.
Na im dem put inside head of one pikin mey e just dey alive feeding alone.
Clothing, and housing.
Den housing and clothing of sixty five million.
Go con go one Nigerian university now wey you go spend close to three million to graduate, wey you no even see wetin e study to start with.
You understand?
Den you go con graduate.
You go con worth over seventy million.
So wetin I mean be sey only, every avera-... average graduate wey dey out dere for street dey roam about is worth over seventy million naira in hard Nigerian currency and maybe you get like four graduate for your house.
Na your life savings just dey loaf around for your house.
Now where di available job wey dey di country?
You understand?
So if de kuku see di job, de dey see job of fifty thousand?
Hundred thousand?
Tell me, pikin wey graduate, wey worth seventy million, plus feeding budget, and education, plus school wey lecturer no kuku dey (na few wey just get di lecturer), now wey graduate con dey work job of fifty thousand, if dat pikin na truly financial investment from di parents, na im be sey dat pikin no go fit pay im mama till e, e die reincarnate even seven times.
So it's called wasted investment.
De now come dey tell dem dere now sey any business wey you dey do for Nigeria now, wey dey regulate you to local currency, my broder, you dey high jump so.
You suppose dey do businesses wey dey allow your financial flow come beyond di borders on a global slate.
Until di country kuku fix insef, since di country no dey allow foreign investors enter, we, we go bring di foreign investors in.
But first of all, you get to change your means of earning.
You get to change di fact wey you must go work by six a.m., close by six, by six in di evening.
Because now, if you dey work on anoder person job, we dey call dat one wetin?
Bribing you for your destiny.
Before you go realize, you don turn forty.
Na at forty na im want con dey realize sey you fit make shoe, or you fit make bag.
So wetin we take dey solve dis problem be number one?
Di number one problem for dis country now, na poverty, and hunger.
Den number two problem, na misplacement of priority.
Because if you go university for Nigeria, go study course for dis current country o!
I no dey talk for anoder country.
If you dey Nigeria, your course na sociology, philosophy, dat's misplacement of priority because e no get value for dis nation right now.
You dey do political science where?
For dis scattered politics?
And na dose co-... CRK, you no go Bible school?
And na dose courses get di highest number of students.
And if you check dese students very well, na students wey deir brain don lock.
De want just pass school anyhow make e be sey dem pass school.
Why you no fit advise dese children?
Make dem go do tings wey go dey put money for deir pocket knowing sey di more graduates wey no get job we dey roll out, na di more problem we dey create for dis country.
Everybody want get certificate.
So first of all now, you wey dey listen to me, you go solve your financial problem, den you go attend my training so dat you go know how to place your priorities right.
And if you don dey work for anoder man job, dey go thirty years, omo e be like sey your judgement na times two.
Because once you reach heaven, God go first judge you for your sins, den judge you for wasting your life.
E go ask you di gift wey I give you make you go practice, how you take use am?
You go work for anoder man own destiny.
So di man no get e own plans?
So first of all, if currently your problem for Nigeria now na how to place three square meal for your table, every morning when you wake up, your work, why you dey go work be sey na you want place three square meal for your table, di truth about di matter be sey you never dey exist.
Di moment you start to exist be sey di moment you don reach dat level wey be sey you wake up, you know sey wetin you, and your family go chop don ready.
At dat point now, naim you fit siddown say oya make we change di country!
You can't tell a man who can not afford three square meals to go, and change di country.
Change what?
Make hungry catch am, e go change im decision in five seconds unless dat worm wey dey im belle no strong.
As funny as it may sound, and as joking as I might be, na so serious di matter dey o.
As funny as it may sound and as joking as I might be, na so serious di matter dey o.
I know sey I dey come from very humble background.
Daddy na reverend, mumsie na pastor.
Den, at di same time, di man na medical psychologist, den mumsy na linguist.
Mtschew when poverty start to dance reggae for inside our house, I tell dem sey see dis thing no go work o!
See I go go di oda way round.
I make up my mind.
I tell dem sey I no dey go do any engineering for any school.
De say why?
I say I wan be pilot.
De say why?
I say outside di fact sey career na career, career, number one thing for career na to make money.
Calling, na dat one wey we dey do.
Sey dis one, na im God give us.
My career, na piloting, my calling, na to help people succeed dis one wey I dey do.
Weda di calling give me money or not e no dey pain me.
But you see dat career piloting, you no go tell me make I come fly plane for you for free now.
You know how much I pay go di school?
While I still dey di school now self, if I fly you now self, sosoliso go be testimony.
You know!
But so wetin I dey do now be sey, we don set up one better organisation, we dey call am di billionaire's code.
For di billionaire's code now, we bring a lot of opportunities wey be sey e fit help you dey make at least five percent on your investment every Friday for di next fifty two weeks.
Meaning sey anyting wey you invest...
Okay meh I call money name.
Let us say you invest one hundred and thirty seven thousand naira, I no go tell you di name of di company.
Na im make I wan make you come di seminar because Nigerian, una too dey smart.
As I tell you di name, you go run go google am, you no go see any information.
I have seen it, I have seen it.
Stop dat ting!
Learn to go to di school of money.
Stop surfing di Internet!
Wetin de put for Internet na review.
De no dey put di original ting dere.
Go, and know what is all about.
So dat's why you must come to a seminar.
No invest inside someting wey you no understand.
E dey pay you five percent.
So sey, sey you invest one hundred and thirty seven thousand.
Chop five percent of one hundred and thirty seven thousand.
Like dat one fit dey run around seven thousand to eight thousand naira every Friday.
And de dey pay you in euros.
You fit withdraw am through ehm cryptocurrency, you fit withdraw through OK Pay, you fit withdraw am through eh your direct domiciliary account.
If you check five percent on one thirty seven thousand for fifty two weeks, dat na like doubling your money by three times.
You understand?
And wetin dis company dey deal on?
De dey deal on real estate, bank liabilities, debentures, IPOs.
You understand?
So, why we bring dis opportunity be sey we wan carry Nigeria comot from Ponzi Scheme.
Wetin be Ponzi Scheme?
Ponzi Scheme na you put one naira, by next week, you dey collect twenty naira.
Who you work for?
How di money take grow?
Den, you no know sey dat system dey rely on people for am to grow.
De no create di money anywhere.
If de get money, e go crash.
Some of dem no dey even last two weeks now.
Now, why you need dose kind of opportunity so dat if you invest something, you go say okay?
Ehen dis particular money wey I invest now, na for my family feeding.
I no get to dey run around.
Sey okay dis one dey bring five percent every Friday.
Every Monday, dey fit withdraw am dey fit.
Den you go know sey di next money wey e dey come, e got anoda investment now wey I no go call di name for radio.
But dis investment na huge investment wey be sey e fit pay you up to twenty thousand dollars with di little investment as low as one thousand dollars in di next seven months to eight months wen de go launch fully for di whole world.
Anoder one, you go find out about am.
Di number three most important thing (outside all dese investment wey I dey talk about), I dey run wetin de dey call financial, and business mentorship.
I go teach una how to position business.
You no need to open shop to open business o.
You just need to dey inside your parlour, inside your bedroom open business.
Mah I give una instance.
When we dey grow up, we know of all dose kind wey de dey call ehn ma-firewood (mean sey de dey sell firewood), ehn ma-akara (mean sey de dey fry akara), ehn mama tailor (mean sey di woman na tailor).
As soon as all dose Shell and NNPC start to enter Nigeria, all dose people carry deir machine put inside packing room, carry deir firewood put di oda side, go find white collar job.
Oya now, now de don go middle of ocean, go bring am out, clean am.
Mey we start from where we stop.
You understand?
When you go some countries like (I no wan call names meh you no come tink sey I dey compare Nigeria to oda countries), you go discover sey...
Infact, mah I call one name, China.
You enter China.
How China take cause deir own revolution?
De lock deir borders for almost twelve, or ten years.
Nobody travel.
Na dem pick people say you travel go learn come back!
E get things wey you...
Infact, Facebook wey we dey use, you know sey China no dey use am.
China no gree.
De say de must use deir own app, sey make Oyinbo dem do deir own app for demself, and Africa.
You no fit dey here and get person wey dey China say if you dey Facebook.
E no possible.
Na so de don develop reach.
See dis guy now (eh wetin be im name) wey get Alibaba dot com, dat guy, na im make online market go popular.
Because dese guys, dem look widin.
You go go China, one full street, every family wetin de sell?
Na light, light, light, light, light, light, and na consistency.
You go anoda street, even dese eh crypto, crypto wey de dey talk, na China make am popular.
Hm na dem start to dey do am.
Almost everything.
Den you come Nigeria.
Where is di China of Nigeria?
Haba!
De go even produce deir own things, still put on top made in Turkey.
Wetin dey worry you?
Na inferiority complex be dat, or wetin?
So wetin I bin try talk in essence be sey, dis Sunday, eleventh of June, two thousand and seventeen, by two p.m. gbangain, as we dey close from church, no enter second service o!

Admission na free of charge, and na because of una we go set up dat event.
Eh if you fit come dat venue, oya, dey come straight.
I dey go dere now, I dey go take my own session.
Na dere you go hear di English version of me.
For dis place now, we dey do am straight to di square root where we dey come from.
Okay, my name na Okemute Imonirhua.
I am from Delta State, I be Urhobo.
De born me for Warri.
And I grow up for Warri.
I stay for Warri till twenty fourteen.
Primary school, secondary school, na close to Warri I attend.
And den, university too, na for Delta State.
So all my life, I live for Delta State until work carry me come Port Harcourt from twenty fourteen.
I be graduate of library and information science, not because sey na wetin I like to study for school, but my mama say I must study medicine.
She wan get doctor.
Tank God my younger broder now don dey for final year for medical school so she go get her doctor.
But, I no like sciences.
So I write my WAEC.
I no pass all di subjects.
She con say okay make I just do pre-degree first.
Den I go rewrite again till I must study di medicine.
But as I enter pre-degree do library science, I tell mysef sey noting go make me go back to sciences.
So na wetin make me study library science for school.
And I, I don't do bad, for school.
I come out wit better grade (you know) wey de call two one.
And den...
But wetin I really like to do before na broadcasting.
So when I finish school, I con get work for radio station by first experience.
No training.
I do dat one.
I con go for service for Bayelsa State.
During service, I con go radio station to go learn.
I suppose to teach but I go meet di school say make de reject me.
I no get wetin I wan use teaching take do.
So I con go radio station.
De train me for dere for phonetics, and everyting, news reading.
Den after NYSC, I con get work again for Warri.
So I work for Warri for radio station as a presenter for about eh two years.
I con leave Warri come...
Actually, I wan come Port, come Port Harcourt dat time, but e no work out like dat.
I con come Port Harcourt for twenty fourteen.
I get job as (ehm de call am call screener for radio).
No be presenter.
Na you go sit down for where de dey receive phone call.
So before di call go enter studio, you first listen to di people, screen dem.
If wetin de wan talk no make sense, you go cut dem.
But if wetin de talk get contribution to di programme, you go allow dem conne-...
Eh you go connect dem to di studio.
I no do dat one for long.
I con get admin work.
So now, na admin, and HR work I dey do.
But because I still like eh broadcasting, along di line, I dey read news.
But di ting dey make e dey too stressful for me because admin work dey dere, and news time na very sacred time.
So sometimes I go miss di news, I go go read am late.
I con get to drop news.
But I still dey hope for when I fit go back to broadcasting.
Before we con start TV station for our company, I dey work for Cool FM, Wazobia FM, Nigeria Info.
De con still open Wazobia Mass TV, and na Pidgin station.
So I audition.
My oga now even tell me sey ah just try am, just try am.
After all, na Warri you grow up.
So na Pidgin.
Una know sey Pidgin, to talk for Pidgin, and to broadcast, mtschew no be di same ting.
But I con audition.
I get di job.
So we never start to go live.
When we go live now, I go dey do di morning show.
And den ehn food show.
We don dey record di food show already (because I like food well, well) for Wazobia Mass TV.
Ehn one issue I like to talk about very briefly, na dis issue of feminism.
Me, I be feminist.
I believe in equality of di sexes.
Even my mama, when we dey grow up, anyting wey my broders dey do, na we dey do too.
She no dey, she will let you know sey if your broder fit do am, you go fit do am too.
So even if she fit no know wetin feminism be, but she, she be feminist.
Because she suffer for her papa hand.
Her pa believe sey girl no be pikin.
So papa no gree train her, suffer her well, well.
So because of dat one, she treat all her children equally.
But feminism now me, I feel sey some people dey take am to anoder level.
So dis feminism no be feminist.
De hate demsefs as women.
Because I don read sey, I read recently sey some women maybe dey talk sey ah why Boy Scouts go dey make women fit dey join Boy Scouts.
And den some women dey call demsefs kings, king of queens.
Noting dey wrong wit being a queen.
Because, male human being na man.
Female human being na woman.
So when you say sometimes di queen is a king, e mean sey you no dey satisfy wit being a queen, and noting dey wrong wit being di queen.
Queen of England, na queen.
And she get husband, but noting take her position from her.
Some of dis feminist...
I be feminist, but some people, de no be feminist.
De dey mislead oder women, de hate to be women, de wan be men by all means.
I should say, many of dis feminism, oder dan de no be feminist, de be anti feminist, but in di name of feminism de dey take di struggle to anoder different level.
Na wetin I know sey if I go, when I get di chance to do my show, I go talk about am well, well.
Sey to dey hate men, no be im go make you say we dey superior to men.
Infact, if you wan say you dey superior to person, you know sey for your mind, you feel inferior to dat person.
Noting dey wrong wit being a woman.
And you fit get all di respect wey you feel sey you deserve, achieve anyting wey you wan achieve while still maintain your respect yoursef, as a woman, still dey live in...
I no know wey I don talk reach five minute now.
Abi make I still dey talk dey go?
Make I still continue?
So yes Sir.
One of di issues wey I dey passionate about, feminism.
Anoder ting again wen I dey very passionate about na my belief in God.
You know yes, ehn I no go fit talk anyting about mysef without mentioning God, and Christianity you know.
Ah no be sey I wan preach now o!
But basically, Christianity for me no be religion.
Na just a new life.
Entering into a new life, and seeing tings differently.
Because e get, I grow up, de born me for Christian house.
But at a point in my life, I con just tell mysef sey abeg eh no be only God wey fit be di way.
I try to explore Eckankar.
Noting dey wrong wit am o, but, I con get eh di encounter one day wit God.
Wetin come make me...
Dat day I wake up, I con dey cry.
I no fit talk about am now because e go dey too long.
But, but dat personal encounter na make me say ah I believe in God not because de born me for Christian home, because of dat my personal encounter wit God.
And in my work, I don dey see many different tings.
Before, I be who dey harsh well, well, but when you know read about loving your neighbour as yoursef all dose tings dey change me.
And noting dey impossible wit God.
Na wetin Jesus Christ talk about.
And I don see am say noting dey impossible.
Because even my life journey from where I start to where I dey right now, everyting na journey of faith.
Even di TV wen I wan start so, which I know sey I go do very well too, na too journey of faith.
So, my Christian life make me believe sey noting dey impossible for me to achieve.
I fit live like get everyting wen I want for dis life, and enjoy di life beautifully in health, in peace, and den of course when I die, I still get hope of where I dey go.
And eh hehe thank you!
Ehm di time wey I dey with my moder, my fader for village, after I con grow (I con dey like eight years), my grand moder con come visit us.

E say okay.
Sey money now no dey to write WAEC.
Na university me I wan go.
I say toh moh dey see wetin God go do for us now.
And dis one wey our country now, notin dey at all again.
Even people weh de dey work for government sef, de dey complain now sey de, money no dey deir own hand too.
Ah my people o, I dey greet una.
So I just wan talk ehn about ehn women battering.
Una no understand wetin di women ba-... ?
Di, di way wey de dey beat, beat women.
Di way wey de mu-...
Di way de no dey even dey treat ehn women as in like human beings.
I no know o.
Dat thing dey really dey happen for Nigeria well, well.
Person go marry, e put woman for house, e no know sey e no like di woman before.
Why e come marry am?
Na wetin I don't just know.
Later, even if na money, e no get.
And just try make you just eh do som-...
Even if na to even leave di house, make you even leave di house!
But na eh vex.
You go just dey vex, you go just dey beat di woman everytime.
Sometime, de go just even carry knife dey, even dey as in chuku di woman everytime.
I no just understand o.
Wait na because woman no fit fight or anything.
And for even Nigeria sef, I no even know wheda de dey even dey look into dis matter.
I no just understand eh.
I no just know.
Dis matter, e just, e don dey high, e don dey high, e don dey increase everyday, everyday by day.
I no just know wetin dey happen.
Di thing, de con even lead to eh eh human eh eh eh trafficking wey person go just see woman...
Even de, even de notice all dis human traffi-... eh trafficking, wey de dey ehn carry ehn women.
De go dey carry dem dey export dem as if no dey be rice.
De be rice.
De be pencil wey de dey export, and import.
Man sef, if de say dem want put man, na one over ten.
Na women go s-... say de be come ehn ninety nine over ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn hundred.
Women be one over ehn hundred.
Why?
De go just dey use women, dey beat dem anyhow.
I dey say make Nigeria look inside dis matter.
E no good, e no good.
Many atimes, dis thing, e dey spoil family.
If children, small children go dey look all dese things, di thing go just dey increase everyday by day.
If eh eh small pikin go just...
We dey think sey all dese small pikin, de no know anything.
I dey tell you sey small pikin, na dem know someting, but pass we wey be adult because, at dat time, nothing dey inside deir brain.
De no dey think of anything.
Na we go dey get all dese thing dey for our head.
We go dey say ah we wan get work, I wan go work, ah di thing wey I dey do for work, di everything wey I dey do for dis place I need to go Oshodi!
All dis thing dey for our brain, but when e comes to small children, de no get anyting for deir brain.
So anyting wey de dey see, wey de dey hear, even if de no sabi speak anything, dose thing dey hook inside deir brain even when dey mature.
So na wetin dey con make dis thing dey continue?
Pikin wey go say e dey see im papa dey beat im mama, if dat pikin grow, you wan tell me sey dat pikin no go be, be wife eh eh eh eh eh beater when e marry?
Na so di thing go be now.
E go just continue like dat, and di thing no go fit stop.
I dey talk sey charity, e begins at home.
Make we start dis thing for, for, for our own sef.
Nobody go do am for us.
Na we go do am for oursef.
We go do am for oursef.
Nigerians, I dey beg una.
Make una act in a good way, make we no dey spoil oursef, make, at, at least, make Nigeria just good.
When e comes to mo, moral civilisation (if na wetin I go call am), make we just dey good to oursef, make we no just dey...
In fact if na our own family member, make we no just dey do bad to our own family members.
Thank you.
I know sey now sef, de don even create...
E good as de don create dis eh women empowerment ehn thing ehn for eh Nigerian, for Nigerian.
And e get one sef (I no even remember di name sef) wey de don create for all dis ehn ehn demoralising ehn di woman, ehn demoralisation of eh women, and even children.
So, when you see person, if na your eh eh dormot, if na your ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn side you see man dey beat women (sometime, de no dey even dey care wheder na outside, de go even naked di woman, beat am well, well), no just leave am say eh di thing no be your own business.
Na your own.
Na everybody business.
Because some people go dey go just want say I beg, make I no put mouth inside di matter.
If dat man kill dat woman for dat place, you no know sey God go, go, go handle you?
God go handle you, God go punish you because you dey dere, you no stop di thing.
If you fit stop di man, stop am!
And if na to go report am to where de suppose to report am, pick am, go police!
Go report to police!
Because dat thing, no good, e no good.
Dat'S why I even like di Oyinbo country sef.
Some Oyinbo country, de no dey allow make person dey touch eh anybody.
If na to touch eh pikin, if na to touch ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn wife, you no su-... you no, you no fit, you no fit try am now, you no fit try am, you no fit do am.
Abeg, when una see wife, wife, women, when any man beat you, go report to police.
Dis one, make una go report.
Report!
Wheder na your husband, e no suppose to do dat one to you.
Thank you o.

My name na Joke Babatunde.
I come from Ondo State.
I dey stay for Ibadan.
I want...
I don stay for so many places for Nigeria.
I don stay North well, well.
I stay for so many places.
I want teach you one kind of soup wey I learn from my friend.
Na Igbo people dey chop am pass.
Di name of di soup na ofe nsala.
For Igbo land, dat mean sey na bitter leaf soup be dat.
Di ingredients wey de dey take cook am na bitter leaf, palm oil, palm oil, pepper, salt, pepper, salt, meat, dry fish, stock fish, shaki (dat one wey dey peel for cow, wey dey inside cow body de peel am), ponmo, ogiri, and Maggi.
Di soup, you go first wash bitter leaf, di bitter leaf well, well.
You go wash am sotay di bitter go comot so dat e no go bitter for di soup.
Den we need anoda ting again.
We need ehn ede.
De dey call am ede for Igbo.
And na ehn cocoyam.
So I go cook di cocoyam first.
If I cook di cocoyam, I go con...
When di cocoyam don done, I go wash my mortar.
I go con pound di cocoyam.
If I pound di cocoyam, de dey put cocoyam for bitter leaf soup because de want make e thick so dat e no go be water, water.
So if I, I wash my bitter leaf fini-... I don wash my bitter leaf finish, I go con put, put water for fire, grind my pepper, pour am inside.
Den pour my shaki, pour my meat, pour my dry fish.
I go put my stock fish.
If I don put everything inside, e go dey boil, I go leave so dat di pepper go enter am well, well.
I go con leave am make e boil well, well.
When e boil well, well, I put my Maggi, put my ogiri, put everything, put my salt make e taste well, well.
So if I see sey everything don boil, di pepper don enter di meat, and di shaki, and di ponmo, everything, I go con pour my bitter leaf.
So if I pour my bitter leaf, I go con put my palm oil inside.
So as I pour my palm oil, everything go con boil.
I go con leave am.
As I con see sey e don boil well, well, e don dey enter, I go con put my, ehn I go con put my, my ede.
Dat'S my cocoyam wey I pound.
I go con put am inside.
So once e just cook, within five minutes wey I see sey e don boil well, well, I go con carry am down.
And dis kind of soup wey I dey talk about, you fit eat am with pounded yam, you fit eat am with fufu, you fit eat am with eh even your semo sef.
But di soup, di soup dey sweet well, well.
So na dis type of soup I, I sabi wey I wan teach you.
I want talk about anoder soup wey I sabi.
Dat soup, na Warri people and, ehn Warri people and, ehn Warri people, and ehn ban-... ehn Bayelsa people dey chop am well, well.
All dis people wey dey Niger Delta, na dem dey chop di soup.
Di soup name na banga.
And di ingredients wey dem dey take cook banga soup na dis palm kernel, palm fruit, palm fruit wey come from pa-... ehn, palm tree.
So we go carry di palm tree wey don ripe well, well, we go comot am, comot, peel am from di back.
I go con boil my, my palm fruit.
Den di ingred-... anoda ingredient wey I need na banga ingredient.
You go just go market.
You go say you want banga ingredients.
Banga ingredients, you get all those ingredients, dem go don pound am for you, you go don mix am together.
Den I need pepper.
Den I no need palm oil again.
I need salt, and I need Maggi.
Because once all those things don dey di soup, everything don...
No need of palm oil because di palm fruit go bring palm oil out.
So if I cook di palm oil, I go con cook di palm fruit.
So once di palm fruit cook well, well, I go boil am.
I go boil am.
When I boil am finish, I go con pound am.
So once e don pound, I go con pour am for mortar, ehn dis thing, wash am,
Con use my hand wash am well, well comot all di palm oil inside.
So if I comot all di palm oil inside, I go con put di palm oil for fire.
As I put di palm oil for fire, I go con put di pepper wey I wan put fresh pepper.
I go don pound am.
Or I fit put dry pepper, anyone wey I like as I want, want am.
So if I pour am inside, I go con put di banga ingredients so dat e go, everything go con boil together.
So as everything boil together, I go con...
Later once e don boil well, well, when I see sey e don dey thick, di oil don dey show on top, dat mean sey e don done, and I go con put my meat.
I go don put my meat, put my fish, put my stock fish, put my crayfish, put everything inside.
So once I don put all these things inside, and everything don boil inside di soup, di soup don do be dat.
So once di soup don do, we dey use am eat starch.
We go do our starch, we go use banga eat starch.
We fit use our banga chop ehn...

Wey be sey, my mama like exercise well, well.
When she dey young young, before she even born us, na athlete she be.
So as she, as she come retire, come born us finish, she come set up di gym.
Small, small, na so we start o.
My people, for, na...
We start with four boys quarter for our house.
Wey be sey, if rain fall sef, you go see di water go soak everywhere.
Na so me, my broder, small children (dat time, we still dey primary school) we would carry bucket of water wit my mama.
We go dey carry, we go dey pack am.
Pack am, pack am, pack di water, climb upstairs, troway am.
Pack water, carry o.
Di same ting.
We just dey rinse, and repeat di proccess.
So as God come bless us, we come dey work hard, we come dey push am.
Before we know, we come find place wey be sey we go rent.
But where I dey now, na Kaduna.
Where we dey now na Kaduna, for di North.
And for our stadium, e get places wey dem, wen de dey give out, wey be sey de dey rent out to people.
So if you wan get, if you get one package wey you wan run (maybe na sport, maybe na dance studio you wan do), you go pay di, you go pay Kaduna Government.
Kaduna Government go give you di place for maybe five, or ten years.
So na so we con sit down, we come open am, we come talk to one lawyer.
So di lawyer now, as we dey open am, we, im tell us sey which name we wan give am?
Which name wan give di business?
My mama talk sey...
Because at dat point, no be sey my mama no love me o.
Ehen my people, my mama love me well, well, ehn but her favourite na my broder Muhammed.
So as de come ask am, di lawyer come...
As di lawyer come ask my mama wetin you wan call dis gym, she come talk sey na Muhammed Gymnasium we wan give am.
Momo'S Gym.
Me, elder man, me, I no even get problem say ah why de no call am my name o?
Give am one oder name!
But at dat point, me, I just know sey we dey open business, and we no go dey pack...
We no go dey use bucket of water, bucket to dey pack water from our gym any more.
So before we know, di lawyer come yarn sey toh di place, di stadium wey we dey is call Murtala Muhammed, Murtala Muhammed ehm Stadium mtschew.
So di lawyer come talk sey toh if we put my broder name for dere, den e go, e go look like sey na di Murtala Muhammed wey own di place.

Naim my mama come tell di lawyer sey she get two sons.
Wetin be oder son name?

At dat time, me, I no know wheder di guy just dey scope my mama o.
Im tell her sey toh Kabiru, de no dey too use Kabiru like dat for business.
Use Kabiru for business, for di business!
So na so di story be.
How de start to dey call di place Kabiru Gymnasium.
No be sey na one kind fantastic ting.
Cause people, I don hear people dey talk sey...
Na so my, my people, make you hear di story o!
I dey gym one day, I dey work.
I know sey I don derail from wetin I dey give you.
Na di history, but I just do, want give you...
Na one better example now.
E get one day wey I dey work hard for gym.
Di clients wey dey dere, wey dey come dey work out wit us, de no know sey me, I be, I be madam pikin.
And me, I no like to dey show mysef anywhere I go.
I like to dey humble, dey quiet, make people no know sey...
So dat way, you go, you go know who be who.
As I sit down, na so one client come dey meet me.
E come start dey give me one kind gist.
I just look di guy.
Di gist be sey e say a'ah.
Sey im hear sey di woman wey own dis place (im no know sey na my mama), sey di woman wey own dis place sey na only one pikin she get.
A'Ah!
I say haba Simbo wetin dis guy dey talk?
Only one pikin she get?
And she no get husband, and na her boy friend...
She dey, she dey sleep wit all dese young, young men.
And na im dey give am.
My people, you see dis kind problem?
I no know.
Why rumours?
Why we too dey carry rumours?
You no know your fact.
You no know anyting.
Now I con call dis guy later on.
Di next day, I leave am make im dey talk im talk.

Ah my, my, my chairman, come, moh we talk, moh we yarn!
I come pull am to one side, tell am sey see dat your story wey you hear, wey you, wey you dey yarn yesterday, dat tory you tell me yesterday, di ting no sweet me.
Because, dis gym, na my mama gym.
First of, she get children.
No be just one pikin she get.
She get children.
I be her last pikin.
And me wey dey talk to you, I senior you wit like two, three years.
We get oder four...
I get four siblings.
Some of dem don marry, don get children finish.
So and di fact wey be sey de talk sey she dey follow young men, my mama is happily married.
My papa dey alive.
So na so one tin led to anoder, I con become good friends wit dis client.
And ehm as God con bless us extra, we con move from Murtala Square.
God bless us, we con buy our land, we come build our structure ontop am.
Till today, dis client still dey come, still dey come dis gym, and im don become like family to us now.
Alright if you listening to me, dis one na my own little parsee of how my first day of, at ehn school, Kaduna State University basically was.
So before, before I bin dey hear sey university na one kind big place wey be sey you just come you know meet people as in.
My own mindset towards dis tings be sey you...
When you enter university, you get to meet di big shots, different kind of guys like dat, but mehn di kind picture wey I con see for dere mehn, di part time tire me walahi.
So when I enter now, as per jambitos now, di usual parade be sey university de no get assembly.
I con jam one guy now.
I con dey like reason wit di guy.
Guy, what's up now?
Where be di assembly ground?
Dis guys laugh me ehn.
Mtschew.
Kai e no easy dat day.
I bin reason like sey make I just like call am quit.
Make I just dey go back to my papa house.
But worst get to worst, I gats move on.
Na life be dat.
So onto di level now, I push forward, dey ask one or two questions like dat, con meet some kind people.
Di way de look me sef, you know di way I dress as per tinking sey onto a big boy level, a jambito coming as a fresher (you know) want to get eh di university life into my head like dat.
So we con get to a level wey be sey we finished registration.
After some weeks like dat, de con tell us sey make we start lecture.
I bin tink sey na dat kind secondary school something wey be sey we go con, we talking you know.
Aha!
Di ting tire me.
I con dey like spark for one of my guy.
I say bros, na so di university dey?
Which kind uniform we wear now?
Na short knicker, abi na long trouser, abi na long sleeve, abi which one?
You know base on my secondary school experience.
But di whole university ting was like a different gig for my liking.
So when di lecture start now, as per di usual parade, con see chicks, see guys.
Everybody dey bubble, dey shuffle you know.
So first lecture come.
I no go forget am.
Maths 101.
Mehn e no easy after some years like dat for just some kind maths though usually no dulling as per kd guy now.
Patapata na one, one o.
No dey lose.
We gader draw.
After di lecture now, we comot.
Na den I know wetin de call school market.
Kai you no need to try di kind jamz wey dey dere!
See restaurant, see fries!
Different kind of tings like dat dey you know.
Wey be sey e go like shorten somebody pocket.
But dat side attraction no too capture me o.
But mehn when I get to see di kind babes wey dey dere, mehn my eye shun.
Mtschew!
I con dey reason.
Na school carry me come, abi na chicks carry me come?
But onto some kind level like dat, man must, you know man must flex like dat now.
So as go con dey go now, I con jam one chick like dat.
Her name na Deborah like dat.
So we con get to dey flenjo now.
So me and dis chick con dey relate onto one on one level.
And lucky enough for me sef, di babe na jambito like me.
She too no get experience.
Me, and her are di same blind horses dey like run for di same dark eh dis ting.
So we con enter restaurant now.
As per a sharp guy, dis ting con dey reason sey na me go pay for her own food matter.
As in kai agbada don hook wire today be dat!
I reason my body up, and down.
Mehn for Hausa, dey call am silva.
Na some kind fifty bucks be dat!
You go fit get be dat!
So dis babe con dey order for some kind tings wey be sey de dey beyond my understanding.
But as per a normal guy, patapata in di morning, you wake up for dis kind ehn northern setting like dat, you no pass meh just go jam small cocoa, and small cosy like dat fifty box.
Patapata you don finish your morning parade.
At least you will organise feel bam like dat for di whole day till maybe later racket go come up like dat.
So na so dis babe just begin order o.
I see fried rice, pshew di ting jump come.
She call for chicken, di ting jump come.
She call for soft drink, di ting jump come.
A'Ah!
Di ting con tire her now.
Sey me, I no dey order for anyting.
She no know sey I don't like...
Shapadly, don code sey all dis ting go dey on me.
So I con dey like blend, blend, blend, blend.
Lucky enough now, when I wan dash now, I see one of my guy like dat cos dat, di guy is...
During di registration, na dere we get to meet ourselves.
So for di restaurant, di oder guy was like bringing di bill for me at last.
When di bill just land my table, na so my eyes, my eyes just shine like sey na person wey see angel, or someting like dat.
I say which kind dis ting be?
I just rake eh.
I just calm down relax, I just forward di bill to di girl, I just tell her sey I dey come.
Dose guy, de need my attention.
So unknown to me sey di babe ma na one kind coded babe.
She gats wan like make I drop my phone so dat dat kind ting, if I dey go, make I no really escape di, make I no escape di billing, someting like dat.
So dere, and den, patapata, I just come back.
Mtschew since I feel like maybe dis ting, she too, as she dey order for dose big, big tings, she dey hope on sey, base on di way wey I kack mysef (you know), di way wey I like couple, and like arrange mysef.

My name na Bukola Ayaniyi.
I be ogbonge madam for soap making.
I dey make soap because I no wan steal, and I no wan be liability for my oga.
And as I dey do di soap, no be sey na me originate di soap before.
Before, before I get shop where I dey sell provision.
But later on, tings do as e wan do.
And me I no fit siddon idle.
Dat'S why one of my friend wey im name be Mama Funmi (na my better friend) naim come tell me sey im broda, de don teach am soap for deir church.
So as de come teach am, e come carry di manual give me say make I go read.
After I read am finish, na so I go buy materials.
So di material for making soap start from sulphuric acid.
Di second one na Tezapen.
Third one na s-... eh caustic soda.
Di fourth one, na ST-... STPP.
Soda ash, Nitrosol, perfume, liquid gel, or foam booster, or formalin, wit colour, and perfume.
Na so I start to dey mix soap.
And I thank God sey even dough de never dey patronize me as I want, but at least, I still dey put something for table for my children.
And I no...
No be sey all my cloth go come dirty for house wey house go dey smell.
I dey wash as I like.
My children dey wash.
We dey clean.
My odour sef, my body odour na correct one because I dey put am correct perfume.
Di perfume wey I dey put start from ambipur.
I dey put lemon fruit, I dey put eh banana flavour, and so oda perfume like dat.
Wey be sey if anybody open my soap, smell am, e go ti-... e go see sey dis one na correct one.
And my soap e no dey spoil cloth, e no dey wash cloth, e dey make cloth beta.
You fit use am wash ankara, wash jeans.
Any type of cloth, you fit use my soap wash.
And I dey do different types of colour.
I dey do lemon colour, I dey do pink, I dey do blue, I dey do green so dat make e dey entice my customers.
Or if de see am, ah which colour be dis one?
Even at times, I dey do orange colour.
Na so o!
So soap making, na correct business o!
Any woman wey e no want im husband make e dey take cloth dey knock im head for house, make e engage imsef for petty work, make e dey do o!
E no good make person dey idle.
Na so o!
First of all, if I want do like fifty liters, I go buy sulphuric acid, two liters.
And dat two liters, at di rate of one thousand, eight hundred naira.
One liter is nine hundred.
I go buy Tezapen six hundred naira.
If I buy all dose tings, I go...
First of all I go mix sulphuric acid wit Tezapen.
I go stir well, well make everyting melt.
Because sulphuric acid, e dey hot well, well.
So if I don stir am well, well make e melt, I go put my st-... caustic soda for water.
Because for fifty liters of soap, I go use ten spoon of caustic soda.
I go soak am for three liters of water.
So if e don melt well, well, I go pour am.
If I pour am wit, wit di ones wey I don mix dat sulphuric acid, and Tezapen, I go pour dat caustic soda.
I go stir am well, well.
Even as you dey stir am, you go dey see di smoke wey go dey come out cause di tin dey hot well, well.
So after dat one, I go still mix my soda ash.
I go put am for three liters of water.
I go mix dat one too.
If e don disolve well, well, I go pour am.
I go stir am well, well.
After dat sulphuric, after em soda ash, I go put STP-... STPP.
I go put dat one for three liters of water because I no dey like make my soap dey watery.
So if I don do am like dat, all dose tings, na so I go dey put am three, three liters of water till e go reach eh perfume.
If I don mix everyting like dat, if water no come reach di amount wey I wan make e reach, I fit add am water because if soap tick well, well, people go buy am.
If e too watery, e no go dey foam well, well.
So na so I dey do my own.
And I dey tank God for my life because I no be liability for my husband.
People dey buy o!
Even dis my sista, na my soap im dey use wash cloth.
All of my compound people dem dey buy soap for my hand.
Dem dey buy am.

E go still channel di tin pass my side wey I go con give di person di reply.
Wheder e get di favourable letter, or wheder di tin, di deal no go work, na me go still pass tell dem.
Even when dey do promotion, and all dis tins, na me still dey carry letter give staff.
Sey dis na wetin dey don do.
I start working at eh University of Ibadan here.
I dey do electrician which de dey call onise ina.
Na dere I dey work.
I don serve...
I almost eh...
At least, e don reach eh thirty five, or thirty four years in service now.
Di work wey I dey do, I like am even though na dangerous work na im be di li-... work.
But I still like am cause I don perfect on it.
Wey I dey do di work very well.
No problem.
Ehn everyting wey we dey do here (we dey lay cable, we dey do wiring, we dey do housing wiring) before light come to di university, na we go do am.
We do m-... we dey mount eh tre-... transformer, we dey mount RI-... RMU.
Many, many things, na im we dey ehn use.
We lay cable, but when we want lay cable (dat big one, cable, if you carry am, na big one), we go lay am for inside gutter wey dem go dig for us.
After we do dat one, we go put light dere.
Light go come make yah for everybody.
Den go know sey we don do am finish.
But na danger work o, if person no know.
But person wey e go don sabi sey e don sabi am, e go concentrate for di ting wey e dey do.
By dis time, even though university did not compensate us for di work wey we dey do too much but we still know sey we still dey work.
We dey still work am.
And eh many people wey dey with us here.
We have eh cable dressing, cable jointer section, we have overhead, we have eh streetlights, we have dose who dey wiring for house.
But our own na cable jointer.
Na we dey bring RMU, na we dey mount eh transformer for university.
Every high, high tension wey we dey do, na our section na im dey do am.
Na we dey do everytin.
Apart from dat, we can do wiring house.
But for our own section here, it's only laying cable, connect transformer, connect eh RMU.
Na only dat one we dey do for our own here.
For dis section, at least, we get three section, two, or two.
En rewinding, e dey.
Oh ehn...
Mey...
Dose who dey re-... repair transformer, e dey, dose who dey connect transformer, e dey.
But for our section here, I be stational head, I be di oga patapata for dis section wey dey do dis place.
Na we dey mount all dis place.
We get...
If an, if de bring form say de, e see dere is a pro-... problem dere, e go bring di form, we go fill am, we go pass am to our oga patapata for up wey e go go do di wor-... send us to s-... to go out, to eh go and do di work.
Na so we dey do here.
Any oda problem wey e dey, you will first of all fill paper say problem dey o for dis section o, de want dem, dis people to come, and do di repair, before we can go.
It's because oga don put instruction down say we should not pass, go beyond im, our boundary.
All dis tin, na we dey do.
Eh dose who dey for under me, we 're at least, we are, we up to ten, or to fifteen.
We have eh dose who dey do nights, afternoon, morning.
That is how we do, divided dem sey make de dey do work.
Dose s-... di people wey dey night now, de dey here early morning.
De dey with us here.
Some people, we dey do regular.
Regular, na im dis...
Everyday!
We dey come everyday.
No shifting for dat people.
Dose who dey do morning, de go come in di morning.
When it is two o'clock, de leave di work.
De go back to their place wey dem dey s-... sleep.
But dose who dey afternoon go come back by two.
De will close by nine.
After nine, dose who do, dey for night, de will take over from dem from, to, to di oda day, di second day, morning because before di morning people come take over from dem.
Dat is how we dey work our work here.
No.
We no dey collect money o.
Na only salary we dey collect here wey yeah di Federal Government dey give us.
If we go work for house sef, for your house now, we no go collect kobo for you.
Because it is our pol-... nai-... du-... call, duty to do di work for you.
E no dey collect money, e no dey collect ego.
Only what we collect, we say if you say we, eh di work wey we do for you sey, e, e please you, you go say take, go buy minerals, if to say na ten naira you bring, we go take eh happily, collect am from you, pray for you sey God go bless you o, e go increase your your wealth very, very well.

Okay my name na Bassey.
People call me Skata.
Em I like to drink ehn beer, but not all beer.
I like to drink ehn Stout, but today I just decide to drink ehn Gulder.
We have ehn Stout, we have Gulder, we have ehn Origin, we have ehn Star, we have ehn different type of beer.
But why I like to drink Stout is dat...
Di, di reason why I dey like to drink Stout is because Stout no dey...
When you drink Stout, you no go dey go piss, piss all di time.
Because, and e will hold your stommy also.
If you wan go long distance, you no go dey go toilet every now and den.
Dat Stout go hold your bele well, well.
Dat is di reason why I like Stout.
But ehn many people like oda branches also.
And I like to come to dis ehn place because deir drink no dey cost.
E get some places wey you go, di Stout, de go tell you four fifty for one bottle, five hundred.
But dis place, you can buy three thou-... three hundred and fifty naira here, and drink.
And beer also, though it is good but e no dey good too much for young people, for children.
Person wey don, wey no dey reach ehn eighteen years above, e no suppose dey drink beer.
Because, if dem start to drink beer, e no go do well for dem.
De no go dey behave well in di house.
Even for deir school, dem no go concentrate.
So is good for someone to grow above di age of eighteen before e can start to dey take ehn beer.
But beer is very good because e would help you.
E would make you know, I mean feel bold.
E go make you to dey feel bold at all time.
Apart from dat, I come here also most of di time to chop because deir food here is good also.
Is ehn hygienic.
Is clean.
De prepare it, de cook it di way wey everybody like it.
De are Calabar people.
As we know, Calabar people na dem dey sabi cook food pass.
So I always come here to chop with dem.
De have, de get edikaikon here, de get epankwokwo, de get garri, and soup, de get eh...
For di soup, de get ehn afiaifere, ebot, de get ehn otong, de get eh ogkuoafan, de, de get eh...
At time, de get diedesi sef here also, de get iwuhabia, de get ozobuko.
In fact de get all type of food here.
De get pepper soup also.
De get ehn cowtail peppersoup, de get fish pepper soup also.
So everything is here.
De get everything here dat someone can eat and enjoy.
Ehn mysef, most of di time, many time, when I come here, I, I like to chop afiafherebo, yeah and auzomahbiah.
For dat auzomahbiah, dey use eh yam to make it.
De pound di yam.
Oyinbo people call it pounded yam.
But dat afihafereboh, de put eh goat meat dere, and de prepare it in di way dat de don't put any...
De cook it in di, in di way de don't put leaf dere.
Di soup na peer, pure white.
Just white like dat.
I don finish now.

You know so I con dey pick am up small, small, I con dey learn am small, small, but eh you know sey everytime wey you go back house, na still English you go speak.
So di thing still no dey sink.
You know so, I con...
You know be-... ehn because I bin dey act, I bin dey work for one oda radio station before, before I start to, before I come ehn Wazobia, so as I come Wazobia now, na more like sey...
Okay den, as de, de employ me for English for Cool TV (because dat, dat time, Cool TV dey), so de employ me for English.
As d-... I, as I...
I still remember di day wey I do di audition, wey, wey my MD talk sey oya, speak for Pidgin mey we hear as thing take be.
Na so I start.
E say no, no, no, no, no, no.
Make I speak English o because e be like sey na di English na im make sense pass for me.
I say ah wahala dey?
E say no, no worry, no worry, no worry!
E say di English dey alright.
Make I just dey for di English.
You know but as time con go on, de con employ me for here you know.
I con start.
We dey do English, we dey do, we dey do, we, we dey do Pidgin.
Den, ehn some kind ehn logistic issues con happen, technical issues con happen.
We con merge ehn Cool TV into Wa-... Wazobia.
Nain everybody con start to gats dey speak di Pidgin.
Me, I con dey wonder sey ah dis Pidgin wey I don dey run from since don con meet me again for here!
Na so I start o, and I still dey be here, and I con dey grow.
I con re-... eh realize sey di Pidgin no be ehn language for people wey no sa-... wey no ehn dey intelligent.
Na for people wey be Nigerian, wey wan communicate, wey wan cut across.
Because as I no sabi speak my language so, I know sey if I still enter ehm ehm di Sapele, or enter di Delta speak Pidgin, I go fit relate to people for dere, but if I speak English, de go dey look me like sey ah bros we no dey speak dis language for here now.
Na Uhrobo we dey speak now.
Why you no speak di one wey we know?
You know.
So, but I con realize sey di Pidgin, anywhere wey I go (because I fit talk say I don travel go like eighteen states for dis, for dis country), and everywhere I go, Pidgin dey always dey represent.
Even if sey no be di same kind of Pidgin wey dey Warri, na im dey I-... I-... Ibadan, na im dey ehn Abuja, you go realise sey if you speak any kind Pidgin, e dey connect.
People go still understand you, ehm ehw wetin you dey talk.
So na why I con even thank di platform say as I don dey here so, I no still lost.
Because if I s-... if I reach where na only English de want make I dey speak, I go dey speak am, we go dey flow.
If I reach where I need to communicate with people for (you know) where I no know before, if I wan go new area, na Pidgin I go dey speak.
So di thing con dey build up, e con dey build up.
Aha I con realise sey for here too, we con dey, we, we, we con package Pidgin like sey na, na one, na international hehe language.
People go dey...
Because me, I dey, I dey do shows wey I dey, I, I dey, I dey, I dey go red carpets, I dey interview people.
So I go cack well, dress co-... confirm o, cack well, wear suit, everything.
And people go con stand okay yes na Wazobia okay.
I want tell di person sey hope sey you no mind, na Pidgin we dey speak o!
Di man go say aha na Pidgin?
I say yes.
Sey ehn ehn you know sey ehn I no too sabi.
I say Madam, na Nigerian you be abi?
You go speak dis thing.
E say oya, oya, oya mey we try, mey we try.
And (so far so good), e con be like sey anytime wey people see me for red carpet, de go wan come make I interview dem because de know sey dis guy, na, na Pidgin e wan talk, no be di English wey we go dey struggle to speak.
We go just dey free.
We go dey relate you know.
So from there, di thing con dey build up.
Di awareness con dey.
Everywhere where we go, de say ah na wo-... Wazobia.
Na una dey speak Pidgin pass.
Na una work be dat.
You know so, di thing con dey build im own ehn level of acceptance, across, everywhere.
No event wey we go even if sey na pre-... president dey come.
You know I, dere was one day wey I, wey I eh interview di Informations Minister.
Dat na ehn Lai Muhammed.
And im, im, im, im, im dey follow me dey talk sey how far now, so how will it be?
I, I say no Sir, na Pidgin we dey speak for here.
E say eh ah oya make we do am now, na Nigerian we be, na our language.
We con dey flow.
So pi-... people wey dey interview am before con see sey we dey laugh, we dey crack joke, we dey laugh ah.
De con dey wonder sey wetin I dey tell am wey, wey bros dey laugh like dis, wey papa dey laugh like dis?
Wetin I dey tell am?
I say ah!
I con realise sey omo na dis Pidgin na im make us connect like dat.
We finish di interview finish.
E shake my hand, e say well done young man, correct, dis one wey, dis na Nigerian.
I say yes Sir, we dey try, we dey try.
So na di platform wey ehn Wazobia con create for us be dat, wey con let us know sey dis Pidgin English no be language wey be for people wey no s-... wey no sabi.
No be for language wey, wey people wey be...
Because de dey call am sey na for people wey dey street, na for ehn low life people.
Na im dey speak di Pidgin.
But you now con realise sey na di only language wey cut across Nigeria without any stress.
You fit go anywhere now if you, if you note, if dere...
One, one time wey I, wey I go SA, I g-... I go South Africa, and I just dey because na, na English we believe sey everybody go dey understand.
But as I con dey, I just enter one mall, naim I see one black man.
Me, and my guy, we just dey talk for Pidgin because we wan, we no wan no, make, make de hear wetin we talk.
We just dey talk for Pidgin, nain di man just tell me sey ah bros, how far, you be Nigerian?
I say oh you understand abi?
Hehe.
I say correct, correct, yea I be Nigerian o.
E say im sef na Nigerian o, but e don dey here for like twelve years.
I say aha hope sey you dey, you dey come back Naija?
So I say, e say im dey come back every year sha, but im dey w-... ehn work for South Africa.
I say ah correct, correct!
So I now realise sey as e dey like dis, Pidgin on im own o, ah e don reach where...
I, I know sey dough, if, if, if na small time now, e go fit reach level wey French, ehn wey English fit con top am.
You know, e go create im own...
Because as e be like dis, di people for Ghana get deir own Pidgin, people for Nigeria get deir own Pidgin, people for, for Cotonou get deir own.
You know, for different countries, for West African countries, de get deir own different kind of, of Pidgin.
So we know sey with time, e dey grow.
With time, e, e, e dey grow.
So basically sha, as, as di shows wey I dey do, wey dey make me dey interact with people everyday, wey I dey go events dey interview dem, na mostly Pidgin.
Even if I see white man on top red carpet, I go tell am Baba, for Nigeria o, we dey speak Pidgin, you go fit try?
E go say ah let us do dis, let us do dis, and e go dey speak am di way e fit speak am because im sef wan identify with di, di language as e be.
So na, na di basic thing wey we dey, wey we dey do be dat.
Okay ladies and gentlemen, make e no for bring quarrel.
Today na Monday, and ehn we don dey move to di different departmental behaviour.
Ehn de say a bird for hand, e worth ehn many b-... many millions for inside bush.
