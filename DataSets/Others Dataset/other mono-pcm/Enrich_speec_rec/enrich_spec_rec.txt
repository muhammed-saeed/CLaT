One of those wey don hama na Bridget Achieng wey come from lungu for Kibera work as housegirl but come   
Her message to pipo wey wan be like her na say notin dey free   
You want a million bucks you gatz do sometin wey worth reach one million bucks You get anxiety You don try everything to fit get over am   
Maybe you think say you don get over am but the symptoms return with vengeance Whatever your situation science science fit help you beat anxiety for good   
Anxiety fit come as fear restlessness you no go fit focus when you dey   
school dey find am hard to sleep for night or things dey irritate you quickly   
For social situations e fit make am dey hard for you to talk to others you fit feel like   
all of dem dey judge you all the time or other symptoms like stuttering sweating blushing or upset stomach   
E fit come out of the blue as panick attack when sudden spike of anxiety   
make you feel like say you wan get heart attack go mad or loose control   
Or e fit come all the time as generalized anxiety disorder   
and too much worry consume you and you begin fear the future   
Do am badly One wa to avoid indecision or to do start that project na to too am badly   
The reason this one dey work well well na because e   
go speed up your decision making process and catapult you straight to action   
Otherwise you fit spend hours deciding hw make you do something or   
wetin you go do and that one fit take too much time   
Wait to worry Another strategy wey dey work na to wait to worry   
If something go wrong and you feel like to worry because   
you think say you don mess up no do am immediately   
Instead postpone your worry give yourself 10 minutes each day when you go fit worry about anything   
Put somebody for your mind Egood make we know how much of our day we spen with somebody for   
our mind If na very little or none at all them you get high risk of poor mental health   
No matter how much we dye work or how much money we dey make we no fit dey truly   
happy until we know say somebody need us and im depend on wetin we fit do and our love   
This one no mean say we need people to praise us but to do something with somebody   
for mind go remove anxiety and worry we go only worry about how we fit help them   
Most people experience am at some point but if anxiety dey affect your life sleep   
your ability to form relationships or to do well for school you fit get anxiety disorder   
Research show say if you no treat am e fit lead to depression early death and suicide   
And while e fit lead to those kind serious health palava the medication wey dem   
dey tell people to use to treat anxiety no dey always work for the long term   
Symptoms sometimes go return and you dey back to where you start from   
The way you cope or handle things for life get direct impack on how much anxiety you fit experience change the way you dey   
cope and you fit lower your anxiety level Capello talk say all the things wey Ibrahimovic sabi do today as a player na him teach am
