In fact dem fit do good. Or, na something wey pipo wey dey show “Something Understood” don dey look inside to find di beta wey fit comot wen pesin make mistake. You remember di saying “na mistakes we dem dey use learn”. Well na true, na from mistake your brain and work wey you fit do dey develop.

If e no be say Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming do mistake for 1928, healthcare now no go be how we dey see am. E discover penicillin, wey be antibiotic, wen e forget petri dish go holiday.

Theodore Roosevelt tok say: “Di only man wey no dey eva make mistake na man wey no dey eva do anytin.” Fear of failure fit no allow us do new tins, but to accept mistake dey free road make we fit say, “on to di next one”. By di time she enta her mid twenties, JK Rowling tok say she bin don fail “for epic scale”. Her marriage bin don scatter, and she and her daughter bin dey live for poverty. For 2008 speech wey she give Havard University graduates, she day “I stop to dey pretend say I be pesin wey I no be come dey focus on top di work wey I care for.” “As wetin I bin dey fear don already happun, I come free myself come see say I still dey alive, my pikin stil dey wey I adore and I bin get my old typewriter and big idea.” And di rest na history, as Harry Potter don make am one of di world most famous and richest authors. Plenti comedies for world don come from tins wey make us shame di time wey im happun. Afta time don pass, mistakes fit dey very funny. So while you dey shame say di rice wey you dey chop for party pour for your new “slay” clothe, na sometin wey you look at laugh later, maybe you go fit tell pipo true dat time.Governor Aminu Mansari for Katsina state don carry goat give secondary school girls say na dia own empowerment be that.

Oda tins wey dey kill pipo wey dey try snap selfies for dangerous places na animals, electric shock, fire and gunshot.  For July dis year 2018, one 19-year-old Gavin Zimmerman bin fall die as im dey snap selfie on top mountain for New South Wales, Australia.

Tiwa Savage and  Adebayo Salami also don talk say man and woman no dey the same level. “After a chat with my buddy, I disagree with women equality. A woman can never equal a man and must not be given a chance to. What women should be fighting for are respect and honour and not equality..
 Why do women want equality?
 Do they want to start paying our bride prices?
 Do they want the capabilities of impregnating a man?
 Do they want to slap us back when we slap them?
 Do they want to rule over us like we rule over them?
 Do they want to be king when they are suppose to be queen?
 Do they want to be traditional rulers and parts of the council of elders?
 Do they want to be heads of the family?
 Do they want a total recognition in being the bread winner of the family? We can’t let the rule of equality stand.
 I am seeing equality leveling us up which means, a woman can own males slaves and order them around
 I am seeing equality were a woman can no longer obey and see men as god
 I am seeing equality sell the right of fatherhood to motherhood
 I am seeing equality render men useless in decision making
 I am seeing equality as end time decision where a woman can marry as many men as she desires..
 The bible never spoke of equality but respect and honour on womanhood. If a woman is allow to wash her husband’s underwear, then I see equality allowing a man wash a woman underwear. I stand with inequality
 The woman should remain in the second tier and must not be given liberty at equality. I stand with Respct and honour womanhood and not equality.
 Thank you Linxum

With dis kain payment system, if you no receive wetin you pay for, you fit raise complaint with di payment system wey you use transfer di money and you go get your money back.  Before you buy that fine handbag or correct sneakers, check wetin other people dey talk about di seller and dia service for di comment section of di vendor social media page. If you no see any comment at all, e fit mean say di vendor dey delete comments for dia page and dat na big comma. E beta make you pay di vendor after dem don deliver wetin you order. If di vendor no gree, you fit request say you go like do about 20% payment and after you don collect your order, you go come pay di remaining money.

If people no too sabi di online seller, e beta make you no buy from dem.  Simple Google search fit save you plenty money.

Atiku never declare yet for any party but many people de feel say na PDP him wan go   Aliko Dangote eye don dey red for di wahala wey im waka inside Africa dey give am. E tok say e need 38 visa to travel around im own continent. Di plan, according to the African Union, na say for 2018 evri African go fit enta any African kontri wey dem like without say dem need visa at all. But till now, na only Seychelles dey allow any African citizen fit enta dia kontri, as dem don always dey do. Latest report wey AU release show say na only 22% of oda African kontris any African fit enta without visa. Dis mata don dey cause wahala (like xenophobia) for African kontris wey get beta economy even though all di policy makers don gree say visa free travel na di only wey make economy blow for di region. One South African travel blogger wey dem dey call Katchie Nzama tok say, “our leaders dey do yeye waka to protect borders wey na colonial masters put for ground.” She visit 35 kontris out of di 55 for Africa. Na di only tin wey dey cause am? Make we check. South Africa na dem get di double standards wey dey show pass for Africa, as dem dey more welcoming of pipo from different parts of di world dan from inside Africa. Na only 15 kontris for Africa fit enta South Africa without visa, but 28 kontris for Europe get free entry to South Africa. South Africa tok-tok pesin for di Department of Home Affairs, Thabo Mokgola dey fight for dia policy. E tell BBC say na two hands dem dey use clap on top di visa mata, “visa waiver agreements dey on a do-me-I-do-you basis and we dey arrange wit some African kontris.” But kontris like Kenya dey give South Africans dem visa on arrival for free but Kenyans wey dey go South Africa dey apply for visa, pay service fee and wait for five working days before dem waka go. In 2015, two years after di African Union order dia members agree to comot visa application wahala for all Africans by 2018, South Africa do u-turn begin announce rules wey make hard wey many condemn. Di recession and tourist wey don reduce make di kontri change dia mind and announce say dem go make am easy for pipo to travel come dia kontri wit hope say dis go helep dia economy.  Aliko Dangote bin complain for interview for 2016 say, “pesin like me, wey get di kain business wey I get, need 38 visas to dey travel for Africa.” E bin dey front of line for pipo wey collect di African passport wey bin comot for 2016 wey suppose replace passport from kontris from Africa. But now na only head of states, senior diplomats plus top AU oga dem.  While Namibia, Mauritius, Ghana, Rwanda, Benin and Kenya dey do visa on arrival or go allow enter for three months with only passports, you still need visa to enter pass half di kontris. While e dey easy to travel within regions like Economic Community of West African states, e dey hard if pesin wan from East Africa to West Africa to do am without wahala. Anoda wahala to travel for Africa na flights no common to dey travel from region to region, and di ones wey dey cost well-well. Kenya travel blogger, Winnie Rioba tok say to travel from Kenya go Namibia na di same price as to go Thailand, and e cheap pass to go Dubai from Nairobi dan to go Morocco. And dis one no even include cost for visa. Ms Rioba tok say dem charge am $90 for visa to Djibouti wen e cost only $75 dollars for Schengen visa wey go give pesin access enta 26 European states.

Di support to comot visa for Africans to travel for Africa get very plenti support but as di year 2018 don dey waka pass, e be like say dat one no go eva happun. And to travel go Yankee or Jand fit sweet pipo for belle dan to travel Africa. Because as Aliko Dangote tok am, “Dem (Africa kontris) dey give visa as if na favour dem do you.”One kasala burst for New York today, when one man, full grown adult, decide say life don tire am, and the next thing wey hin reason to do na to kill hinself.

You don try everything to fit get over am? Maybe you think say you don get over am, but the symptoms return with vengeance? Whatever your situation, science, science fit help you beat anxiety for good. Anxiety fit come as fear, restlessness, you no go fit focus when you dey school, dey find am hard to sleep for night, or things dey irritate you quickly. For social situations, e fit make am dey hard for you to talk to others; you fit feel like all of dem dey judge you all the time, or other symptoms like stuttering, sweating, blushing or upset stomach. E fit come out of the blue as panick attack, when sudden spike of anxiety make you feel like say you wan get heart attack, go mad or loose control. Or e fit come all the time as generalized anxiety disorder, and too much worry consume you and you begin fear the future. Do am badly: One wa to avoid indecision or to do start that project na to too am badly. The reason this one dey work well well na because e go speed up your decision-making process and catapult you straight to action. Otherwise, you fit spend hours deciding hw make you do something or wetin you go do, and that one fit take too much time. Wait to worry: Another strategy wey dey work na to ‘wait to worry’. If something go wrong and you feel like to worry (because you think say you don mess up), no do am immediately. Instead, postpone your worry – give yourself 10 minutes each day when you go fit worry about anything.

No matter how much we dye work or how much money we dey make, we no fit dey truly happy until we know say somebody need us and im depend on wetin we fit do and our love. This one no mean say we need people to praise us, but to do something with somebody for mind go remove anxiety and worry, we go only worry about how we fit help them.   Most people experience am at some point, but if anxiety dey affect your life, sleep, your ability to form relationships, or to do well for school, you fit get anxiety disorder. Research show say if you no treat am, e fit lead to depression, early death and suicide. And while e fit lead to those kind serious health palava, the medication wey dem dey tell people to use to treat anxiety no dey always work for the long-term. Symptoms sometimes go return and you dey back to where you start from. The way you cope or handle things for life get direct impack on how much anxiety you fit experience –  change the way you dey cope, and you fit lower your anxiety level.Capello talk say all the things wey Ibrahimovic sabi do today as a player, na him teach am.

I know say you go dey reason say that na common something, but with all the things wey I wan add to am, e go make am different and make sense. E go make photo sharing fun again.
Fleaqr dey aimed at say make you dey share wetin dey happen for your life.
The way Fleaqr dey, na only picture wey you take now now you fit share. This mean say you no fit upload picture wey you don take before.
Fleaqr get 12 custom built picture filters to make your picture better and we still dey work on many more.   Wetin make you think go that side, wetin inspire Fleaqr?

Oga Atiku na pesin wey don eye di office of di presido for many many years. Im get experience as one of di politicians wey bring PDP come in 1999 even though im comot to join di opposition, like prodigal pikin im return back to PDP. Muscle: Atiku get deep pockets, im don make plenti moni from im businesses like American University of Nigeria, TV and Radio Gotel, Faro Water etc. Like di way voters support American billionaire Donald Trump unto im business skills, dis dey make Atiku fine for eye of pipo wey go like make im grow di economy and give dem work as im don promise.

Half of di population of Nigeria na women, so e fit follow say dem go support fellow woman like dem. Hamstring: ACPN what?!

To learn handwriting no be by force again for schools wey dey US and some other countries don follow comot am from dia list of subjects.  But why some countries like UK still dey do am for dis age of technology?

Public Health England (PHE) tok say di health worker catch di sickness wey no too common afta im go treat patient wey get di disease for bodi inside Blackpool Victoria Hospital  Monkeypox: Nigerian Don Cari First Case Of Di Disease Enta United Kingdom   Monkeypox: How Di Virus Enter 7 Nigeria States  Nick Phin for PHE National Infection Service tok say, “Dis healthcare worker dey treat di patient before test show say e get monkeypox.” Phin still tok say, “We don put dis pesin for separate corner inside hospital and we dey take serious care to make sure say we trace all contacts.” Im add put say, “We don dey torchlight pipo for di past 21 days wey fit get connection wit any pesin wey get di sickness so dat we fit sharperly handle di mata”. Dem don begin dey treat di third case for one specialist unit inside Royal Victoria Infirmary for Newcastle, north east England.  Monkeypox: No Chop Bush Meat – Health Ministry  Monkeypox na viral infection wey no popular and e no dey spread from pesin to pesin. Di virus dey like smallpox, wey dem don pursue patapata for 1980. Even though monkeypox no dey harsh like smallpox because most pipo wey catch am dey recover afta few weeks but sometimes e fit kill di pesin wey get am. For beginning of September, health officials say dem find two pipo for Britain wey get monkeypox afta pesin travel come from Nigeria and dis na di first ever case of monkeypox inside Britain.  Oga Phin for PHE don tok before say monkeypox virus fit spread for Nigeria afta plenti outbreak happun for 2017, and dis fit affect travellers wey dey return back to Britain.“At first dis project start like game, we bin just be friends wey come togeda to do sometin wey dey sweet belle,” na wetin 26-year-old Brian Gitta tok. “But afta about one year I say, come guys, we dey enjoy oursef, but I think say we fit change lives wit wetin we dey do.” Brian dey tok to di BBC just weeks before im win di Royal Academy of Engineering Africa innovation prize on top im malaria testing tool. Four years before now, Brian and im fellow students for Makerere University, come up wit dis chickini moni tool wey pesin fit use again, dem call am Matibabu wey dey check and find malaria sharp sharp without to remove blood from pesin bodi. Although e still dey sample stage, di society judges callhis malaria testing machine “simply one game changer” for di fight against dis disease wey dey kill. ‘Matibabu’ wey mean “treatment” for Swahili, dey uses magnets and one small special design portable tool dem call matiscope. Di device dey shine red light show for di finger of pesin wey use am, dey find wetin dem call hemozoin crystals, wey be product from malaria parasite. Those wey make am believe say Matibabu fin change ot even turn di situation on to say e go make testing time dey fast since e no need to remove blood, and also e no dey use use injection needles wey pikin especially dey struggle wit. Last year, 9.5 million pipo for Uganda suffer malaria including 5,100 wey die inside, most of dem na pikin dem be. “My pikin bin suffer convulsions without any sign and e no gree eat, im bin happy dey play around one moment and dey go school, and e fall sick di next,” Achan Nighty tok as she sidon on top di bed near her six-year-old son for Kitgum Hospital inside northern Uganda. “We dey live very far from di clinic inside one small farm. I need to take care of my three oda small pikin dem and I no get moni, so it take me three days to come here. I pray say e neva dey not too late.” she tok. Brian first come up wit dis idea wen im suffer one serious malaria sickness, join wit typhoid. Wen e dey hospital, e bin imagine na quick and pain-free testing machine dem go use check am without needles and even choom im bodi. Im join wit graduates wey get skills for engineering, computer sciences and infectious diseases. Di BBC Innovators story dey show how pipo wey get beta ideas dey solve problems for many parts of South Asia and Africa Learn more about BBC Innovators . Di latest number five-generation Matibabu model only need two minutes to find malaria as against 30 or more minutes wen e go take wit di use of microscope. Di oda testing method wey dem accept now, na Rapid Diagnostic Tests, wy dey take up to 15 minutes and e require to remove blood but e no fit show di number of parasites wey fit lead to too much tresatment. Since Matibabu no require any blood sample, e n need specialist wey get medical training to operate am, so na sumtin di communities demsef fit use on dia own. Even sef Matibabu dey connected to smartphone, meaning say e fit collect data, send alert go give health teams informate about malaria sickness wey e find. “Many pipo dey live for village and di roads dey bad, so to go health centre na problem,” according to Kitgum hospital director Dr Geoffrey Akena. “To try to solve dis problem we don send village health teams wey dey travel around di region dey treat pipo, but we no get informate so dem just dey waka upandan not knowing where dem need to face.” For many parts of Uganda, e reach 1.5 million bad case dem geton top malaria wey dey happun evri year wey dey turn to serious complications, according to di Ministry of Health. E mean say dis disease don dey too late to treat. Malaria dem fit cure am sharperly and e go show improvement if treatment happun within di first 24 hours. Matibabu go help close dis gap and ensure say treatment dey readi and available for those wey need am quick-quick. Game changer? But no be evritin dey clear. Di current Matibabu machine fit check and find 80% of malaria cases, e still far from 99% wey be di level international practice accept, na sometin Brian dey aware of. “Our machine heavy pass di previous model dem, e dey connected to one personal computer, and you no fit put your finger since di light dey shine on one blood sample. But our focus now na on di next lab test dem wit 300 patients and to perfect di machine, we go improve di design later.” Brian dey tok while im dey hold im machine wey dey like small suitcase-size, dey stand outside one clinic outside of Kampala, wey be one of many clinic dem im visits to explain to doctors how im machine dey work. Upon di challenge dem, Brian still dey confident say Matibabu go work and im dey look for $600,000 so dem fit enta market by di next two years – wit hope say n aim machine dem go use for future to test for oda diseases like anaemia. Consider say malaria dey kill almost half a million pipo evri single year, mostly small pikin dem wey dey live inside Sub-Saharan Africa, so Brian career and reputation dey at stake.

E fit change as we dey use internet and dis one na because of wetin dem dey call ‘net neutrality.’ Di truth be say di internet no be di same way e be, before-before. Even if person carry dia phone or use dia computer and use ‘www’ to visit any website dem like, e no dey work as e dey do before.

Net (Network) neutrality na idea say di people wey dey provide internet (internet service providers) ISP like Mainone, MTN, Spectranet and co, go make internet dey equal for everybody. Di neutrality be say your ISP no suppose dey block some website or reduce di speed or make dem allow some other site dey load fast-fast.

See things like ‘Arab Spring’ wey happen as young people dey talk democracy for country like Tunisia, na because people fit use internet, na so things easy. People go dey look as di matter dey go because of di December 14 vote wey FCC take comot net neutrality. Di thing be say, some things wey person dey use for internet fit dey affected. Maybe na di way you dey use internet or di kain money person dey spend for some kain services. If dem allow net neutrality, ISPs fit arrange say make di money people dey pay increase; if e no pass, den some site go start dey slow or you no go fit stream some things. Your ISP fit even block people wey dem no like. No be just for US, as e be so, no forget say e get some kain products like Netflix wey person dey watch film for and for plenty Africa country, many of dem no get servers.According to Namushi‏ @ThaNewMe for twitter, them one call one of him friend ‘something’ so them kon ask am about him friend whether make them call am for the something or make them no call am but him talk say him no talk anything because say him no like the thing wey that him friend dey always yarn ontop twitter so the people kon remove that him “friend” commot from the list of the “something” wey them one call am for.

Dr Oscar Odiboh wey bi founder of Afribaby Inititiative talk about how plans dey go for im organisation wey wan feed motherless pickin dem with breast milk wey other mothers don donate. Im say many other countries like US and even South Africa dey do breast milk bank, and na one of di ways wey pickin wey dem born as premature and pickin wey no get mama again (motherless babies) go take use breast milk as food for di first 2 years of dia life.  According to World Health Organisation (WHO), e dey very good to give only breast milk to pickin dem for di first six months of dia life so dat dem go get good health and grow well-well.  WHO believe say breast milk fit reduce infection for baby, especially for di pickin dem wey dem born as premature Breast milk bank na place wey dey collect and store human breast milk from women wey don donate am to dem. Na di breast milk bank go make sure say di milk no get disease inside am, and dem go treat am well-well, come carry am put for inside freezer. Breast milk dey important for pickin wey no get mama again or di mama no dey available. And also, pickin wey dem born as premature. Di first human breast milk bank bin start for Vienna, Austria for 1909. Di country wey get di most breast milk bank for di world na Brazil, wey get like 221. Africa countries like South Africa get pass 60, Cameroon get 6 and Cape Verde get 1. Dr Oscar say dem don get some lab equipment for testing, wey dey very necessary to make di breast milk bank work, but “support from people dey slow maybe because of recession”.  One way breast milk idea fit work na if teaching hospitals dem begin do am direct, as dem get many of di facilities already, but even then, hospitals go need to create new section for am and dis one go dey very difficult, im believe. On top of dat one, government need create laws wey go make sure say things go well-well, but dem never chook mouth inside di matter. “Di government no even dey think about am, dem no get any framework because if to say dem think am dem go don start am demsef”, Dr Oscar talk. But di big problem wey him and any other person wey wan start breast milk bank for place like Nigeria go get, na di society wey no get correct knowledge about breast milk and di trust wey dem no get for organisation and government say dem no go do mago-mago. “Confidence no even dey for immunization… and for even blood transfusion, people dey afraid because dem no sure say dem don test am well.”  Na so Mrs Habiba Abdulmalik wey be nurse for Abuja talk. She also say she no go wan give her breast milk for breast milk bank because dem fit begin take am do business. Mrs Dele George, wey bi oga for Little Saints Orphanage, popular place for Lagos wey dey collect and take care of motherless pickins dem, talk say if breast milk bank start for Nigeria, she no go collect milk from dia give her pickin dem because she no get confidence say dem go don do things well.  Although Mrs George believe say Nigerians including am, go begin use breast milk banks if public awareness don dey and di people wey dey behind am dey follow di process well well. When we ask some women about whether dem fit give dia baby milk from breast milk bank, Mrs Christiana, wey dey sell food say “I no fit do am… instead I go give my baby formula, because I no fit use another woman milk”. Even though she say she no go mind to donate her breast milk for free to give another woman wey need am. Mrs Doreen Ezeala, tell us about one time when she breastfeed her sister baby, as her sister don go work and she sef just born at that time. So for am, she no see anything wey dey wrong in am. One businesswoman wey no wan make we mention her name, say she no go mind to give her pickin breast milk from another woman if her pickin need am. “Before-before for Nigeria, people no wan adopt pickin… in fact, I remember when I dey primary school e get one boy wey everybody know say dem adopt, and anytime wey e do something bad, students go abuse say na because say im be adopted pickin.

Lack of electricity na big challenge for di kontri Nigeria and di goment over di years don try different kain tins to solve di problem. So na who work e be to give kontri pipo light? Di wahala of electricity for Nigeria get to deal wit three group of pipo, first na di goment, den di operators wey dey generate plus distribute di electricity, and di third one na di naija pipo ghan wey dey use di light for dia houses and business dem, according to Sunday Oduntan, di Executive director of Association of Nigeria Electricity Distributors (ANED) tok. One of di solutions wey di former president Goodluck Jonathan administration come up wit na to bring in private companies to take major control of electricity production and distribution, while federal goment dey completely in charge of di transmission. For any Nigerian to get light for im house, di following pipo must do collabo to make am work;  Generating companies (GenCos), dia work na to produce electricity for Nigeria. Di kontri get six companies wey dey generate electricity plus 28 power plants. Three out of di 28 power plants dey use water take create light while di remaining 25 dey depend on gas.  As e dey today, all of di six GenCos na private companies and dem each get 60 % shares while federal goment keep 40%. Afta GenCos don produce di electricity, na di responsibility of di transmission company to transport am from wia dem produce am to wia dem go distribute am. Transmission Company of Nigeria dey only one and na di only company wey get di right to transport electricity for di kontri. E belong to di federal goment. Di third important part of di chain na di distribution companies (DisCos), na dem dey carri light go everibodi domot. Nigeria get eleven DisCos and all of dem dey privatised except one wey, di company wey buy am bin return, dat one dey goment hand now. Like di GenCos, di DisCos too na only 60% of di companies dey private organisations hand, goment get di remaining 40%. And na goment officials dey be head for all di companies. Although di three companies dey work togeda, expert wey tok to BBC News Pidgin say, lack of corporation dey make am difficult for light to reach pipo wey need am. Dis points na part of di reasons, according to di expert; •Di price wey dem dey sell electricity to Nigerians dey far less dan di amount wey dem take produce am. •Some of di goment officals wey suppose monitors production, transmission and distribution, either no too understand wetin dey for di industry, or dem no just wan corporate to make tins work. • Nigeria neva fit match di amount of electricity wey dem dey produce wit di size of di population. Nigeria na kontri of 120millio pipo, but e dey only produce 5,222 megawatts. • Old age wan kill di transmission grid. Di transmission grid don reach 62years and dem neva change am. Dis one dey make DisCos lose watts of electricity before e go reach wia e suppose go. •Distributors no dey do all di tins wey dem suppose to give pipo light. •Nigerians too like free tins so dem no dey like to pay light bill. •Nigeria goment sef lack will power to make Nigerians pay for di light wey dem use. Las las, e say, “na only Nigeria goment fit make decision wey go affect dem wey be goment, di companies and di pipo.Presdent of South Africa, Jacob Zuma don resign say hin no be president again o Zuma talk this for nation wide television broadcast dis evening.

This 2018 be like say na make sense year because na so so good news we dey hear.For January 2017, at least 10,000 people nai lose their home for Southern Democratic Republic of Congo. Dis na after floods make one river overflow kill people and scatter towns and villages. For February, heavy rain cause flooding for di city of Rabat and Sale for Morocco. For di same February, cyclone Dineo land for Inhambane province for Mozambique wey cause flooding. For May, Kenya and Tanzania no escape as heavy rain swallow many area. July na di turn of Lagos and Niger states for Nigeria. By August, dem declare national emergency for Sierra Leone after im suffer from heavy flooding wey expert say fit be di worst for Africa for di last 20 years.  So, from Guinea, to Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso and Uganda, flood just dey waka about dey cause havoc all over Africa. Wetin dey cause all dis flooding? Some experts don blame lack of planning and poor drainage systems for some of di African countries for di floods dem but aside from that something else dey happen.  “Di weather pattern don change. Temperature dey rise, floods dey happen.” Dat na how environmentalist, Desmond Majekodunmi, take describe am. Im say di problem be say many people still dey doubt say climate change dey real. ”Scientists don tell us say if we continue to dey warm di planet di way we dey do, we go get more floods, worse sef and this na classic example of climate change,” na so im talk.  Im talk say although rain been dey fall before before, but di way im dey fall now point to climate change. Experts talk say 2016 na di hottest year for record, 2017 so far be second after 2016. Infact na 15 of di 16 hottest years dem don record since 2000. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions dey go up, oceans dey warm and sea ice dey melt and all dis dey affect heat and rainfall record.  Experts talk say dis na di result of climate change. Too much carbon dioxide for di atmosphere don lead to global warming and na man activities dey cause am.  Burning of coal, gas and oil for power plants and cars, cutting down and burning forests na part of wetin man dey do to cause global warming. Wetin be di way forward ?  Almost 200 countries around di world come together for 2015 for Paris for di Climate Change Conference wey dey happen every year, dem agree say dem go move commot from di burning of fossil fuels wey include coal and oil wey dey cause this climate change. Dis na so that global temperature go dey normal and di world go dey safe. Many countries don dey move go clean energy source like solar and wind.  Some experts don talk say di world need to work hard and fast pass wetin dem dey do now to dey able to meet di target in order to save di life Mr Majekodunmi talk say urban planners now need to consider climate change when dem dey build cities, and houses. Say dem suppose plan cities in a way wey to adapt to di effects of climate change.  ”West African nations wey get hundreds of millions of people for im coast, low line coast wey dey vulnerable to climate change, ocean rise and surges need to come together to say we must stop to dey burn all those bad bad fuel for di environment to avoid serious wahala.” Im say individually, everybody get role to play, as people must dey part of nature because human being get duty to protect am.  “Di world suppose do more to protect di environment, di three key things na to reduce carbon, increas forest cover and developing countries need to do something about hydrochlorofluoro carbons wey dey Air Conditioners and Refrigerators wey also dey bad for the environment.”According to Mrs. Chioma Mmiriukwu who be dietician, na the kind food wey we dey eat dey determine the kind of sleep we dey get for night. She talk say food wey no get better nutrients dey cause high blood pressure and diabetes for we body. She say make we dey eat food wey get plenty protein like egg, 4 hours before we sleep. Na that one go make us enjoy our sleep well well. Fruits good for body well well as we know, so she advice say make we eat plenty fruits all the time and vegetables too. Say make we no play with vegetables o! Na that one dey make our body strong gidigba, and our sleep go kuleleJust Incase say you miss the award because you no get money go the show, or you like sleep like me (Jonah), I don compile all the names of people wey win and dia category.

Meanwhile di volume of trade between Nigeria and Britain bin don dey reduce tey tey.

Dr Oscar Odiboh wey bi founder of Afribaby Inititiative talk about how plans dey go for im organisation wey wan feed motherless pickin dem with breast milk wey other mothers don donate. Im say many other countries like US and even South Africa dey do breast milk bank, and na one of di ways wey pickin wey dem born as premature and pickin wey no get mama again (motherless babies) go take use breast milk as food for di first 2 years of dia life.  According to World Health Organisation (WHO), e dey very good to give only breast milk to pickin dem for di first six months of dia life so dat dem go get good health and grow well-well.  WHO believe say breast milk fit reduce infection for baby, especially for di pickin dem wey dem born as premature Breast milk bank na place wey dey collect and store human breast milk from women wey don donate am to dem. Na di breast milk bank go make sure say di milk no get disease inside am, and dem go treat am well-well, come carry am put for inside freezer. Breast milk dey important for pickin wey no get mama again or di mama no dey available. And also, pickin wey dem born as premature. Di first human breast milk bank bin start for Vienna, Austria for 1909. Di country wey get di most breast milk bank for di world na Brazil, wey get like 221. Africa countries like South Africa get pass 60, Cameroon get 6 and Cape Verde get 1. Dr Oscar say dem don get some lab equipment for testing, wey dey very necessary to make di breast milk bank work, but “support from people dey slow maybe because of recession”.  One way breast milk idea fit work na if teaching hospitals dem begin do am direct, as dem get many of di facilities already, but even then, hospitals go need to create new section for am and dis one go dey very difficult, im believe. On top of dat one, government need create laws wey go make sure say things go well-well, but dem never chook mouth inside di matter. “Di government no even dey think about am, dem no get any framework because if to say dem think am dem go don start am demsef”, Dr Oscar talk. But di big problem wey him and any other person wey wan start breast milk bank for place like Nigeria go get, na di society wey no get correct knowledge about breast milk and di trust wey dem no get for organisation and government say dem no go do mago-mago. “Confidence no even dey for immunization… and for even blood transfusion, people dey afraid because dem no sure say dem don test am well.”  Na so Mrs Habiba Abdulmalik wey be nurse for Abuja talk. She also say she no go wan give her breast milk for breast
