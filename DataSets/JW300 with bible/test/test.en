Do not be anxious , for I am your God .
During an assembly , a brother asked me if I would like to preach .
We went to the territory , and he gave me some booklets about God’s Kingdom .
One of the sisters there gave us children Bible lessons based on the Bible and the book The Harp of God .
As a teenager , I enjoyed giving people hope from God’s Word .
The brother stopped his bicycle and asked me to sit down with him on a log .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to judge who is a goat ?
Let’s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judging to Jehovah . ”
Another older brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we sometimes have to endure patiently .
Years later , his patience was rewarded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
After the war , I pioneered for two years in southern Ireland .
We did not realize how much power the priests had .
I had never sailed before , so I was excited .

The crew of missionaries aboard the Sibia ( left to right ) : Ron Parkin , Dick Ryde , Gust Maki , and Stanley Carter
Often , they gave us fresh fish , avocados , and peanuts .
Then at dusk we rang the ship’s bell .
It was lovely to see how seriously some of them took their assignment .
When we arrived , I met and fell in love with Maxine Boyd , a beautiful missionary sister .
So I said to myself , ‘ Ronald , if you want this girl , you’ve got to act quickly . ’
After three weeks I proposed , and after six weeks we were married .
Maxine and I were assigned as missionaries to Puerto Rico , so I never went out on the new boat .
For example , in the village of Potala Pastillo , there were two Witness families with many children , and I used to play the flute for them .
I asked one of the little girls , Hilda , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
We bought her a pair , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her assignment in Ecuador , and she said : “ You don’t recognize me , do you ?
I am the little girl from Pastillo who had no shoes . ”
At first , Lennart Johnson and I did most of the work .
Nathan Knorr , who was then taking the lead among Jehovah’s Witnesses , came to Puerto Rico .
Later , he gave me strong counsel about being organized and said that he was disappointed in me .
Father did not accept the truth when Mother and I did .
My dear wife , Maxine , died in 2011 .
I am really looking forward to seeing her again in the resurrection .
After 60 years on the island , I felt as Puerto Rican as a coquí , the popular little Puerto Rican tree frog that sings ko - kee , ko - kee at dusk .
Some who come to see me want to discuss personal or family problems .
Everything we do at Bethel is sacred service .

In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus said : “ Rejoice and be overjoyed , since your reward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance , but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today .

And he named the second one Ephraim , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . ’ ”

Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings . ”

( Read 1 Peter 1 : 15 , 16 . )
Why can Jehovah view us as righteous , even though we are imperfect ?
He accepts as his worshippers those who dedicate themselves to him .
What did Jesus mean when he next said : “ Let your will take place ” ?
How does the ransom benefit humans who have died ?
What is God’s will for the “ great crowd ” ?
( a ) What blessings do we now receive from Jehovah ?
( Read Acts 3 : 19 - 21 . )
“ We have come to know and believe the love that God has for us .
And should we at times change a decision that we have made ?
This article will help us to answer those questions .
Yet , Jehovah viewed those kings as having a complete heart .
Will God view us as having a complete heart , despite mistakes we make ?
We lived on a small farm in eastern South Dakota .
Farming was an important part of our family’s life , but it was not the most important part .
My parents got baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1934 .
My dad , Clarence , and later my uncle Alfred , served as company servant ( now called coordinator of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in Conde , South Dakota .
My sister , Dorothy , and I became Kingdom publishers when we were six .
Conventions and assemblies were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who supported my decision to pioneer .
When they were serving congregations nearby , they sometimes invited me to go with them in the ministry .
As a new Bethelite , with a farm truck
The farm on Staten Island included the radio station WBBR .
Only 15 to 20 members of the Bethel family were assigned to the farm .
Most of us were young and quite inexperienced .
Brother Peterson did his work at Bethel well but never neglected the field ministry .
With Angela in 1975 , before a television interview
Three years later , we were invited to Bethel .
Why do Jehovah and Christ deserve to be honored ?
Humans were created “ in God’s image . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) How do Jehovah’s Witnesses view government officials ?
( Read 1 Timothy 5 : 17 . )
Moreover , do not call anyone your father on earth , for one is your Father , the heavenly One .
Neither be called leaders , for your Leader is one , the Christ .
But the greatest one among you must be your minister .
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
Why should others not make decisions for us ?
( a ) To make wise decisions , we should have faith in what ?
What will help us to make wise decisions ?
( Read James 1 : 5 - 8 . )
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 24 . )
Loving elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( See paragraph 11 )
Elders too should take time to do research .
Will it bring joy and peace to my family ?
And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’
Why does Jehovah expect us to make our own decisions ?
What does it mean to serve Jehovah with a complete heart ?
Which of the four kings would you like to imitate , and why ?
( Read 2 Chronicles 14 : 11 . )
What would your heart move you to do ?

( Read 2 Chronicles 20 : 2 - 4 . )
( Read Isaiah 37 : 15 - 20 . )
( Read 2 Kings 20 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chronicles 34 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chronicles 34 : 18 , 19 . )
( b ) What will we discuss in the next article ?
Why will we consider the examples of four kings of Judah ?
( Read 2 Chronicles 16 : 7 - 9 . )
( Read 2 Chronicles 32 : 31 . )
Many praise him for what he has done .
( Read 2 Chronicles 35 : 20 - 22 . )
The Bible says that Necho’s words were “ from the mouth of God . ”
Let us meditate on these Bible accounts and be thankful that Jehovah has provided them for us !
How many vows have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedication vow or your marriage vow ?
When we believe that we have personally experienced or observed an injustice , our faith , humility , and loyalty may be tested .
“ The world is passing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God remains forever . ” ​ — 1 JOHN 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and corrupt organizations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is passing away . ”
There is no darkness or deep shadow where wrongdoers can conceal themselves . ”
Later in the same psalm , we read : “ The righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the meek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organized ?
After Armageddon , will there be any organization on earth ?
So the “ new earth ” will be organized .
What kind of wrong activities are common where you live , and how are you and your family affected ?
What do we learn from Jehovah’s judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah ?
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 6 - 8 . )
( Read Psalm 46 : 8 , 9 . )
What are some things that will be gone forever after Armageddon ?
Illustrate . ( b ) How can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is gone ?
“ WILL the Judge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
Christians expect to experience some injustice outside the Christian congregation .
In 1946 , he attended the eighth class of Gilead School in New York , U.S.A .
After graduation , he was eventually assigned to the circuit work in Switzerland .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
In this article , we will consider Abraham’s great - grandson Joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What injustices did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Loyalty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake .
Most important , he did not allow the imperfections and wrong actions of others to separate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Judge of all the earth ” ?
What will we consider in the next article ?
See Willi Diehl’s life story , “ Jehovah Is My God , in Whom I Will Trust , ” in the November 1 , 1991 , issue of The Watchtower .
( See opening pictures . ) ( b ) What questions will be answered in this article ?
They are excellent examples for men and women today who choose to make vows to Jehovah .
How serious is it to make a vow to God ?
What lessons can we learn from Jephthah and Hannah ?
2 , 3 . ( a ) What is a vow ?
( b ) What do the Scriptures say about making vows to God ?
He should do everything he vowed he would do . ”
( a ) How serious is it to make a vow to God ?
( b ) What do we want to learn about Jephthah and Hannah ?
( a ) How easy was it for Jephthah and his daughter to pay his vow to God ?
Jephthah said : “ I have opened my mouth to Jehovah , and I am unable to turn back . ”
( b ) What did Hannah’s vow mean for Samuel ?
She took Samuel to High Priest Eli at the tabernacle in Shiloh and said : “ It was for this boy that I prayed , and Jehovah granted my petition that I asked of him .
The second most important vow that a person can make is the marriage vow .
What does the Bible say about divorce and separation ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 10 , 11 . )
One couple said : “ Since we have been studying this brochure , our marriage has been happier than ever . ”
We are doing much better now as a couple . ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) What have many Christian parents done ?
( b ) What can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
Special full - time service vow ( See paragraph 19 )
It is not the people but their assignments that are viewed as special .
See the Appendix article “ The Bibleʼs View on Divorce and Separation ” in the book “ Keep Yourselves in Godʼs Love . ”
Does the Almighty care that you are righteous , or does he gain anything because you follow the course of integrity ? ”
( b ) How did Israel defeat Jabin’s army ?
( Read Judges 4 : 14 - 16 . )
The torrent of Kishon washed them away . ”
See the article “ Anxiety About Money ” in the July 1 , 2015 , issue of The Watchtower .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What injustice did Naboth and his sons experience ?
( b ) What two qualities will we consider in this article ?
What kind of man was Naboth , and why did he refuse to sell his vineyard to King Ahab ?
Naboth was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King Ahab and his wife , wicked Queen Jezebel .
Read 1 Kings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He respectfully explained : “ It is unthinkable , from Jehovah’s standpoint , for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers . ”
Why would humility have been a protection to Naboth’s family and friends ?
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders announce a decision that you do not agree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter corrected , and what questions arise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible .
3 Helping “ Foreign Residents ” to “ Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing ”
The second article considers how applying Bible principles will help immigrant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ We could see people running , shooting .
My parents and 11 of us siblings fled for our lives with only the clothes on our backs .
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refugees ?
He said : “ When they persecute you in one city , flee to another . ”
( b ) are living in a camp ?
My feet were so swollen that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to abandon me to the rebel forces — ​ carried me .
They gossiped , drank , gambled , stole , and were immoral . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refugees show gratitude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are refugees ?
( a ) What temptation do refugees need to resist ?
Finally , he held up the empty bag and said with a smile : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of today’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is restricted .
( b ) What will we consider in the following article ?
She said : “ The brothers there treated them like close relatives , providing food , clothes , shelter , and transportation .
Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
Only Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refugee arrives , elders should follow the direction in Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the meantime , they can ask discreet questions about a refugee’s congregation and ministry to discern his spiritual condition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ​ — 3 JOHN 4 .
How can parents set a good example for their children ?
How can family heads decide which language congregation the family will attend ?
How can others help immigrant parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What problem do many immigrant children experience ?
( b ) What questions will this article discuss ?
“ But after I started school , I began to prefer the local language .
Within a few years , the shift was complete .
I couldn’t understand the meetings , and I didn’t identify with my parents ’ culture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to depend on Jehovah for their daily needs .
Never get so busy that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Parents , if that describes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
A child who communicates best in another spoken language deserves the same concern , would you not agree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her studying , praying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we understood that getting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we personally found convenient .
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
Together , we regularly attended meetings and shared in the ministry .
We also invited local friends to join us for meals and excursions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Friend .
We considered this to be much more important than their mastering our language . ”
Samuel adds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also attended meetings in our language .
Life was very busy , and we were tired .
But we thank Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the basics of my parents ’ language , but the language spoken at the meetings was over my head , ” recalls Kristina .
“ When I was 12 , I attended a convention in my school language .
For the first time , I understood that what I was hearing was the truth !
Another turning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Young people , do you think that you would prefer being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my siblings and I got into our teens , we wanted to switch to the local - language congregation , ” says Nadia , who now serves at Bethel .
“ Now we’re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has enriched our lives and broadened our opportunities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their children’s heart .
Both children and parents benefit from association with the congregation ( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with student talk assignments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoyed the leisure activities we shared in as a group . ”
Parents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chronicles 15 : 7 . )
Put your child’s friendship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests .
But it wasn’t until 1946 that I really understood Bible truth .
Eventually , I learned sign language and had fun playing with the other children .
She accepted a magazine subscription and wanted me to meet her husband , Gary .
Eventually , five from their class became Jehovah’s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a piece of candy and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 1960 , her parents did not come to our wedding .
My son Nicholas and his wife , Deborah , serve at London Bethel
Faye and James , Jerry and Evelyn , Shannan and Steven
We are now part of the Calgary Sign - Language Congregation , where I continue to serve as an elder .

How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deepen our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have affection for our brothers ?
What may have caused the love of some Christians to grow cold ?
People today have less and less love for God .
This is the greatest and first commandment . ”
Show love for Jehovah ( See paragraph 10 )
( Read Psalm 119 : 97 - 100 . )
Show love for Bible truth ( See paragraph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among yourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
Show love for the brothers and sisters ( See paragraph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Thessalonians 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — JOHN 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some . ’
So they cast it , but they were not able to haul it in because of the large number of fish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valuable lesson did a brother in Thailand learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
I finally realized that in order to put Kingdom interests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
“ After planning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a street vendor and sell ice cream .
In the beginning , I struggled financially and got discouraged .
When I met my former workmates , they would laugh at me and ask why I thought selling ice cream was better than working with computers in an air - conditioned environment .
I prayed to Jehovah , asking him to help me to cope and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
I got better acquainted with my customers ’ tastes and became more skillful in making ice cream .
Soon , I was selling all my ice cream every day .
Actually , I was better - off financially than when I worked with computers .
It has made me happier because I do not have the stress and worry that I had with my former job .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only regret I have is that I lost so much time before I realized that serving Jehovah brings far more happiness than pursuing the entertainment offered by this world . ”
Jesus said : “ Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two masters . ”
He added : “ You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 . )
See the article “ Is Your Recreation Beneficial ? ”
We also shared regularly in the field ministry . ”
We were so sad to leave our Bible students behind . ”
But then , a month later , they received thrilling news .
Miriam says : “ We were invited to serve as special pioneers .
What a joy to be able to stay in our assignment ! ”
They trusted in the promise found at Psalm 37 : 5 : “ Commit your way to Jehovah ; rely on him , and he will act in your behalf . ”
Today we do , and we lack nothing of real importance . ”
Why can we expect that marriage and family life will involve some trials ?
We can be sure that he wants the best for us , as he did for his servants in the past . ​ — Read Jeremiah 29 : 11 , 12 .
( Read 1 Samuel 1 : 4 - 7 . )
“ Even though Ann was not related to me , I found her loving concern to be such a help , ” Paula explains .
“ It helped me to keep serving Jehovah . ”
( Read Psalm 145 : 18 , 19 . )
“ Where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — LUKE 12 : 34 .
As we do so , meditate on how you personally can deepen your love for these spiritual treasures .
Can you imagine how precious that pearl was to him ?
( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apostle Paul describe our ministry as a “ treasure in earthen vessels ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as Bethelites , pioneers , and elders .
Irene says , “ When I think of other goals I could have pursued , I can’t imagine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
What is the “ treasure store ” that Jesus referred to at Matthew 13 : 52 , and how do we fill it ?
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To test Peter , the rabbi asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and checked the Watchtower and Awake !
magazines from the previous months , I found an article explaining that Daniel was written in Aramaic . ”
As you do this , you will build up “ treasure in the heavens , where no thief gets near and no moth consumes .
For where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ I had trouble getting along with a brother who worked with me .
Once when we were yelling at each other , two people came in and witnessed our blowup . ” ​ — CHRIS .
“ A sister with whom I often preached suddenly ended our arrangements for the ministry .
I had no idea why . ” ​ — JANET .
“ I was on a three - person phone call .
One of the others said good - bye , and I thought he was off the line .
I then said unkind things about him to the other person on the phone , but the first person had not hung up . ” ​ — MICHAEL .
“ In our congregation , two pioneers began having problems .
Their bickering was discouraging to others . ” ​ — GARY .
“ Do not become upset with one another on the way . ”
“ Plans fail when there is no consultation . ”
Michael says , “ My brother genuinely forgave me . ”
“ Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That difference may seem unimportant ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my irritation grew , I started being curt with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I deserve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began seeing my own personality flaws , and I was very disappointed in myself .
I realized that I had to adjust my thinking .
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I bought the sister a small gift and wrote her a card to apologize for my bad attitude .
We hugged each other and agreed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”
FOR many people today , money is the big issue .
Why must the issue of sovereignty be settled ?
How important is the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty ?
Why , from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death , all things are continuing exactly as they were from creation’s beginning . ”
( Read Isaiah 55 : 10 , 11 . )
( Read Job 1 : 7 - 12 . )
( Read Job 38 : 18 - 21 . )
( Read Romans 5 : 3 - 5 . )
One reason is that he rules with love .
He cares for us better than we can care for ourselves .
How can elders and family heads imitate Jehovah ?
Published by Jehovah’s Witnesses but now out of print .
Psalm 147 repeatedly encourages God’s people to praise Jehovah .
What was it about Jehovah that impressed the psalmist so much that he wanted God to be praised ?
Many young brothers and sisters are zealously entering the full - time service .
“ Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches . ” ​ — LUKE 16 : 9 .
How can we avoid becoming slaves of today’s commercial world ?
In this system of things , why will there always be some poor people ?
What can we learn from Jesus ’ counsel ?
How do we know that today’s commercial system was not part of God’s purpose ?
Give examples of how some are showing faithfulness in their use of unrighteous riches .
I am more generous in being forgiving , in being patient with others , and in being able to accept disappointments and counsel . ”
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 13 - 15 . )
How did Abraham show that he trusted in God ?
( b ) How can we apply Paul’s counsel today ?
After calling Timothy “ a fine soldier of Christ Jesus , ” Paul told him : “ No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life , in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier . ”
Jehovah blesses those who are “ rich in fine works . ”

“ FOR almost a year after the death of our son , we felt deep and excruciating pain , ” said Susi .
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 . )
Every single time , the peace of God truly guarded our hearts and minds . ” ​ — Read Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
How did Jesus show empathy when Lazarus died ?
If you are grieving , you too can find soothing comfort from such scriptures as the following :
( Read 1 Thessalonians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about grief ?
Even when someone does express how he feels , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is trying to say .
At that moment , I don’t feel quite so alone in my grief . ”
“ Receiving a short encouraging message or an invitation to spend time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says Junia .
“ Those expressions make me feel loved and cared for . ”
“ Sometimes when sisters have come to comfort me , ” recalls Dalene , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .
They start praying , often battling to speak at first , but every time , within a few sentences , their voice gets stronger and they say the most heartfelt prayer .
Their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strengthening . ”
“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ”
“ I expected my first wedding anniversary to be very traumatic , ” relates one brother , “ and it was not easy .
But a few brothers and sisters planned a small gathering of my closest friends so that I wouldn’t be on my own . ”
“ Often the help and companionship offered when there is no special anniversary can be very beneficial , ” explains Junia .
“ Those spontaneous moments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving arms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . ”
Other scriptures that many have found comforting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 121 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 57 : 15 ; 66 : 13 ; Philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
See also the article “ Comfort the Bereaved , as Jesus Did ” in the November 1 , 2010 , issue of The Watchtower .
“ We don’t know what to say except that we love you .
We can’t understand exactly how you feel , but Jehovah does and will keep raising you up .
We hope that our prayers will help a little . ”
“ May Jehovah sustain you at this time of such great loss . ”
“ May you find comfort in knowing that your dear one is safe in the memory of God , who will remember every detail about him and bring him back again . ”
“ Your loved one will never have to face the last enemy , death , ever again .
In the meantime , his acts of faith live on until he stands up alive and whole in the Paradise . ”
“ While words fail to capture the pain of losing a loved one , we look forward to the time when words will fail to capture the joy of having our heavenly Father return your dear one to you . ”
During the great tribulation , Christians will rely on Jehovah and not try to defend themselves
In an apple orchard in Grójec , a publisher shares the Bible’s message with one of the workers
( b ) What can we learn from studying Psalm 147 ?
And there may be trillions of galaxies in the universe !
I want you to enjoy your life as one of my Witnesses ! ”
( Read Psalm 147 : 8 , 9 . )
Mutsuo says : “ I felt that Jehovah was right next to each one of us and caring for us .
12 , 13 . ( a ) To benefit from God’s help , what should we avoid ?
On the other hand , God “ hurls the wicked to the ground . ”
“ Jehovah finds pleasure in those who fear him , in those waiting for his loyal love . ”
15 - 17 . ( a ) How might we at times feel about our trials , but how does Jehovah use his Word to help us ?
Today , Jehovah guides us with his Word , the Bible .
( Read Psalm 147 : 19 , 20 . )
What plans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
YOU young ones will probably agree that before starting a journey , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his image . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also drew close to Jehovah by studying the Scriptures .
“ Plans fail when there is no consultation , but there is accomplishment through many advisers . ”
As with any career , you need time to become skilled .
At first , I couldn’t start any Bible studies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several studies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from North America , writes : “ When I was seven , many of my classmates were Vietnamese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made plans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by comparing the English and Vietnamese editions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese - language group .
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progressed to baptism . ” ​ — Compare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
After I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
It’s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progressed to baptism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named Kevin says : “ Ever since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time someday .
Finally , I started pioneering when I was 19 .
I supported myself working part - time for a brother who was a builder .
I learned to install roofs , windows , and doors .
Later , I spent two years with a hurricane relief team , rebuilding Kingdom Halls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I applied and was invited to go .

We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each week .
The plans I made as a boy have made me happy in ways I did not foresee . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .

At Bethel , I enjoy hearing firsthand about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then plan to do what is pleasing to him .
He has studied human behavior since man was created .
It’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ Do not let them lead you into disaster ! ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be struck with terror or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go . ”
Listen to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article highlights how Jehovah can do the unexpected by accomplishing things we could never imagine .
Like the farmer , we need to wait patiently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Micah ?
( Read Micah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Micah , we will be willing to wait for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with patience and joy . ”
Abraham had to wait many years before his grandsons Esau and Jacob were born ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just imagine Abraham’s joy when he is resurrected back to a paradise earth .
Although you meant to harm me , God intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wait patiently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has richly rewarded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wait patiently ?
What lessons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philippi ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
Soon after he arrived in Macedonia , he ended up in prison !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to Paul ?
Both he and Silas started “ praying and praising God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Paul’s situation change unexpectedly ?
What will we now discuss and review together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
We need to act in harmony with our prayers .
Sometimes he surprises us by doing the unexpected .
Jehovah sent an angel to destroy 185,000 of Sennacherib’s soldiers in one night .
( a ) What lesson do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehovah’s actions exceeded all of Joseph’s expectations .
Think , too , about Joseph’s great - grandmother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah cares for us and wants us to succeed .
How can we strip off and keep off the old personality ?
By 1939 there were 6,000 of them in the [ concentration camps ] . ”
And you people have cleaned the stadium so nicely .
But most of all , you are truly multiracial . ”

What helped Stephen to put away anger and abusive speech ?
He says : “ Our family life improved dramatically .
Today , Stephen serves as a ministerial servant , and his wife has been a regular pioneer for several years .
Bible texts that encouraged me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had abandoned sinful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah patiently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
We also benefit from God’s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings .
What will be discussed in the next article ?
Some of the names in this article have been changed .
See chapter 25 in the book Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work , Volume 1 .

We are so thankful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in showing mildness and patience ?
Then he added : “ If you continue showing favoritism , you are committing sin . ”
Why is it important that we clothe ourselves with love ?
Love is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get puffed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ Little children , we should love , not in word or with the tongue , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in dealing with this person ? ’
After reflecting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my coworker had been coping with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress .
I concluded that she probably did not really mean what she wrote .
Reflecting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when provoked helped me to show similar love to my coworker . ”
By leaving heaven , “ he emptied himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
PEACE : “ Putting up with one another in love ” allows us to enjoy “ the uniting bond of peace . ”
Would you not agree that such a peaceful spirit is truly unique in today’s divided world ?
Paul wrote : “ Love builds up . ”
The following day , they had outgrown the venue . ”
Below the picture was the caption : “ Invasion of the streets . ”
One congregation wrote , “ The only line that passes near this place is a telegraph line . ”
In Mexico , 2,262,646 people attended the Memorial in 2016 .

( Read Exodus 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be interested in what the Bible says about compassion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah send angels to Sodom ?
( Read Exodus 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers , warning them again and again , because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .

How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents expend much effort and resources helping their children reach goals in such areas as sports , recreation , and education .
It makes so much more sense to expend effort and resources in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great source of satisfaction not only to see our children reach spiritual goals but to share the journey with them . ”
Give examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( Read Titus 2 : 3 - 5 . )
( a ) How can baptized brothers be courageous ?
( Read Philippians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We urge all baptized brothers to be courageous and work hard for the congregation !
Therefore , “ be courageous . . . and go to work . ”

The apostle Peter quoted Isaiah 40 : 8 .
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 24 , 25 . )

Are we not grateful to Jehovah for his written Word , the Bible ?
See the box “ A Turning Point . ”
Take time to explain , illustrate , and apply verses that you read
“ A turning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the speaker referred to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
Those verses liken God’s Word to a mirror in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us .
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I resisted this new idea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to expect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a scripture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is quoted as saying : ‘ Come , now , you people , and let us set matters straight between us . . . .
Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ Come on , Vicky , let’s set matters straight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was unable to sleep that night .
I still doubted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a sudden , it dawned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
It was as if I had been throwing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by meditating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

The following year , I was appointed as a special pioneer , along with Mary Henshall .
We were sent to unassigned territory in the county of Cheshire .
It is a great joy to know that there are now many Witnesses in that area .

( b ) What can parents today learn from Daniel’s parents ?
( Read Job 1 : 9 , 10 . )
19 , 20 . ( a ) How can we imitate Job’s faith and obedience ?

( Read Daniel 6 : 7 - 10 . )
( Read Job 31 : 24 - 28 . )
( Read Psalm 11 : 5 ; 26 : 4 . )
So ask yourself , ‘ Do I know Jehovah as well as Noah , Daniel , and Job did ? ’
Noah’s great - grandfather Enoch also “ kept walking with the true God . ”
Jesus said : “ Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day . ”
It’s hard for me to express the joy we feel . ”
For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit . ”
Jesus said : “ These things I have spoken to you , so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full . ”
( 3 ) How will our effort to have “ the mind of Christ ” help us to be spiritual people ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 - 16 . )
What does the Bible say about spiritually - minded people ?
What can we learn from the example of Jacob ?
What can we learn from the example of Mary ?
( Read Luke 1 : 46 - 55 . )
( Read Isaiah 63 : 9 ; Mark 6 : 34 . )
Rachel , a sister in Brazil , says : “ I loved to follow the world’s fashions .
As a result , I did not dress very modestly .
But learning the truth moved me to make the needed effort to be a spiritual person .
Making changes was not easy , but I became happier and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are witnesses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ affect your daily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the motions .
I looked spiritually strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an auxiliary pioneer a few times a year .
He says : “ It was as if I knew nothing .
I thought to myself , ‘ If I am going to be my wife’s spiritual head , I have to do something . ’ ”
He says : “ I studied the Bible and studied and studied some more , and the pieces started to fit together .
I got understanding and , most important , developed a close relationship with Jehovah . ”
( 3 ) How can strong spirituality help us in our daily life ?
( b ) What is our goal when we study and meditate ?
( b ) What Bible example can we imitate ?
12 , 13 . ( a ) What will help us to apply Romans 15 : 5 ?
( Read 2 Peter 1 : 5 - 8 . )
How will being spiritually - minded affect our life ?
What are the “ dead works ” that we should avoid ?
Will my decisions help me to set spiritual goals ?
Why do you want to move forward spiritually ?
The apostle Peter urged Christians in the first century : “ Be hospitable to one another . ”
Rise , get baptized . ” ​ — ACTS 22 : 16 .
What do Christian parents want to be sure of before their children get baptized ?
“ FOR months I kept telling Dad and Mom that I wanted to be baptized , and they often talked to me about it .
They wanted to make sure I knew how serious my decision was .
On December 31 , 1934 , the day came for this momentous event in my life . ”
5 , 6 . ( a ) The Bible’s description of Timothy leads us to what conclusion about his baptism ?
( Read Colossians 1 : 9 , 10 . )
He told Jehovah that he was so happy about his little girl’s decision to dedicate her life to Him . ”
( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not pressure anyone to get baptized ?
What questions will we consider in the next article ?
If you are a parent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be hospitable at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He writes : “ I hesitated initially because we were newly married and living in a small house .
But having students stay with us was truly a joyous experience .
As newlyweds , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pursue spiritual goals together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospitality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One evening my wife was particularly homesick , and my efforts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p.m . , we heard a knock on the door .
There stood a Bible student who brought us three oranges .
She had come to welcome the new missionaries .
We invited her in and gave her a glass of water .
If you feel anxious about having guests , you are not alone .
An elder in Britain admits : “ There can be a measure of nervousness in preparing for guests .
But as with anything in relation to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfaction that result far outweigh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply sitting down with guests over coffee and talking . ”
Another elder writes : “ Having friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instructors really put me at ease .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the traveling work , their best weeks are those spent staying with a spiritual person who may not have much materially but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keeping life simple .
This reminded me of what my mum used to say to us as children : ‘ Better a dish of vegetables where there’s love . ’ ”
( Read Proverbs 25 : 21 , 22 . )
Hosts usually prepare well for their guests ( See paragraph 20 )
The psalmist David asked : “ O Jehovah , who may be a guest in your tent ? ”
It is also important to respect local customs .
Why is it so important to “ be hospitable to one another ” ?
Two brothers offer a tract to a painter on the bridge in front of Kaštilac , a fortress built in the 16th century , near the city of Split
( Read Titus 2 : 11 - 14 . )
The elder recalled : “ Graham had a problem with pride .
He was critical of the elders who had been involved in his disfellowshipping .
So for the next few studies , we discussed scriptures on pride and its effects .
Graham began to see himself clearly in the mirror of God’s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After acknowledging that he had been blinded by a ‘ rafter ’ of pride and that his critical attitude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God’s Word earnestly , and to make daily prayer a habit .
‘ I’ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I’ve even served as a pioneer .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Shepherd the flock of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under compulsion , but willingly before God ; not for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; not lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”
( b ) What will we consider in the next article ?
How can parents raise their children in the discipline of Jehovah ?
( Read Hebrews 12 : 5 - 11 . )
How does a child develop self - discipline ?
4 , 5 . ( a ) Why is self - discipline an important part of “ the new personality ” ?
How can we become better students of God’s Word ?
One brother wrote : “ I am filled with gratitude for the way my parents raised me .
( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedience to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daughter was reinstated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleasant for them ?
They did not berate me or criticize me , but they encouraged me and strengthened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how busy they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God’s love .
Time and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confirm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is crouching at the door , and its craving is to dominate you ; but will you get the mastery over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”
People around the world are demanding more freedom .
15 Imitating Jehovah ​ — A God Who Gives Encouragement
“ If the Son sets you free , you will be truly free . ” ​ — JOHN 8 : 36 .
( Read 1 Chronicles 29 : 11 , 12 . )
To enjoy the ‘ good , ’ humankind must trust God and obey him .
If they disobey , they will be left to decide for themselves what is good . . . and what is not good . ”
Like that pilot , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?
( Read Romans 7 : 21 - 25 . )
( Read Romans 8 : 1 , 2 , 20 , 21 . )
( c ) What questions do we need to answer ?
( Look under INTERVIEWS AND EXPERIENCES > ENDURING TRIALS . )
All things are lawful , but not all things build up . ”
What example did Noah and his family set for us ?
They lived in a violent and immoral world .

( b ) How did Jehovah encourage his Son ?

How did Hezekiah encourage the military chiefs and the people of Judah ?
How did Peter ‘ strengthen his brothers ’ ?
But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out ; and you , once you have returned , strengthen your brothers . ” ​ — Luke 22 : 31 , 32 .
Whom can we encourage today , and why ?
How can the elders give counsel in an encouraging way ?

She also shared with me her own experience with the kind of test I was going through , and I felt less alone . ”
King Solomon wrote : “ A word spoken at the right time ​ — how good it is !
A cheerful glance makes the heart rejoice ; a good report invigorates the bones . ”
For you have made me rejoice , O Jehovah , because of your deeds ; because of the works of your hands I shout joyfully . ”
The apostle Paul promised : “ God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
You are never too young to set goals .
Proverbs 21 : 5 says : “ The plans of the diligent surely lead to success . ”
The earlier you make plans by setting good goals , the sooner you will have success .
With a university degree in law , I could have earned a lot of money , but I would have had little chance of finding part - time work . ”
17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
I was born in a one - room log cabin in a very small town called Liberty , Indiana , U.S.A .
Later , my mother gave birth to my two younger brothers and my younger sister .
DURING my school years , not much changed .
The town of Liberty was surrounded by small farms , and the basic crop was corn .
She took us to the Baptist church every Sunday .
They wanted me to make the military my career .
This time , however , they invited me to come to a Congregation Book Study , a small meeting for Bible study and discussion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I couldn’t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Years before , when I asked my mother about Jehovah’s Witnesses , she simply said , “ Oh , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being opened !
I started pioneering the next year , in 1958 .
Gloria was a jewel then , and she is a jewel today .
Gloria and I got married in February of 1959 .
A dear brother , Simon Kraker , interviewed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accepting married couples at that time .
Most of our jobs paid three dollars a day .
Each week , Gloria did ironing for one family .
I remember one time when we stopped at a gas station .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Meanwhile , I started a study with the couple’s daughter and her husband .
Mother and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had dear friends in the white congregation .
The Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) , an organization that promotes racism and violence , was very active then .
In 1962 , I was invited to attend the Kingdom Ministry School at South Lansing , New York .
However , a telephone company in Pine Bluff had interviewed me for a job .
If they hired me , I would be the first black man to work for that company .
I had no money to travel to New York .
She said , “ Go to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
Here is how Gloria remembers our time in Pine Bluff : “ I fell in love with the territory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the morning and then conduct Bible studies the rest of the day , sometimes until 11 o’clock at night .
While we were pioneering in Pine Bluff , we applied to become special pioneers .
Brother Leon Weaver , now the coordinator of the United States Branch Committee , was appointed to serve as a circuit overseer at the same time .
I was nervous about becoming a circuit overseer .
After I was appointed , Brother Thompson was the first district overseer I served with .
In those days , a circuit overseer received little training .
I remember saying to Gloria , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the KKK held a march in a town we were visiting in Tennessee .
The following month , we began our Bethel service .
Gloria was a jewel when I married her , and she still is
Then in 1999 , I was appointed to be a member of the Governing Body .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquillity and security . ”
Second , we must pray for God’s holy spirit .
If the house is deserving , let the peace you wish it come upon it ; but if it is not deserving , let the peace from you return upon you . ”
So I greeted her in her own tongue .
Taken by surprise , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your visit ? ’
I politely told her that I wished to see the High Commissioner .
She telephoned the official , who came out to meet me and greeted me in the local language .
After that , he carefully listened to me as I explained to him the peaceful activities of the Witnesses . ”
